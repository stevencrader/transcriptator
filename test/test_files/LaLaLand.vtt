00:01:05.401 --> 00:01:07.300
<i>Ba-ba-da ba-da ba-da-ba-ba</i>

6
00:01:07.401 --> 00:01:09.200
<i>Ba-ba-da ba-da ba-da-ba-ba</i>

7
00:01:09.301 --> 00:01:11.100
<i>Ba-ba-da ba-da ba-da-ba-ba</i>

8
00:01:11.201 --> 00:01:12.600
<i>Ba-ba-ba</i>

9
00:01:12.701 --> 00:01:14.800
<i>I think about that day</i>

10
00:01:14.801 --> 00:01:17.000
<i>I left him
at a Greyhound station</i>

11
00:01:17.001 --> 00:01:18.500
<i>west of Santa Fe</i>

12
00:01:18.501 --> 00:01:22.200
<i>We were seventeen,
but he was sweet and it was true</i>

13
00:01:22.301 --> 00:01:25.900
<i>Still I did
what I had to do</i>

14
00:01:25.901 --> 00:01:28.000
<i>'Cause I just knew</i>

15
00:01:28.101 --> 00:01:29.800
<i>Summer, sunday nights</i>

16
00:01:29.801 --> 00:01:33.600
<i>We'd sink into our seats
right as they dimmed out all the lights</i>

17
00:01:33.701 --> 00:01:37.500
<i>A Technicolor world made out
of music and machine,</i>

18
00:01:37.601 --> 00:01:41.200
<i>It called me
to be on that screen</i>

19
00:01:41.201 --> 00:01:43.200
<i>And live inside each scene</i>

20
00:01:43.201 --> 00:01:47.300
<i>Without a nickel to my name,
Hopped a bus, here I came</i>

21
00:01:47.401 --> 00:01:49.500
<i>Could be brave
or just insane,</i>

22
00:01:49.501 --> 00:01:51.000
<i>We'll have to see</i>

23
00:01:51.001 --> 00:01:52.900
<i>'Cause maybe
in that sleepy town</i>

24
00:01:53.001 --> 00:01:54.800
<i>He'll sit one day,
the lights are down,</i>

25
00:01:54.901 --> 00:01:58.700
<i>He'll see my face and think
of how he used to know me</i>

26
00:01:58.801 --> 00:02:02.100
<i>Climb these hills
I'm reaching for the heights</i>

27
00:02:02.201 --> 00:02:06.000
<i>And chasing
all the lights that shine</i>

28
00:02:06.101 --> 00:02:09.900
<i>And when they let you down,
(It's another day of...)</i>

29
00:02:10.001 --> 00:02:13.700
<i>You get up off the ground,
(It's another day of...)</i>

30
00:02:13.801 --> 00:02:20.800
<i>'Cause morning rolls around
and it's another day of sun</i>

31
00:02:21.401 --> 00:02:23.400
<i>I hear'em ev'ry day,</i>

32
00:02:23.401 --> 00:02:27.000
<i>The rhythms in the canyons
that'll never fade away,</i>

33
00:02:27.101 --> 00:02:30.800
<i>The ballads in the barrooms
left by those who came before</i>

34
00:02:30.901 --> 00:02:34.400
<i>They say
"you gotta want it more"</i>

35
00:02:34.401 --> 00:02:36.600
<i>So I bang on ev'ry door</i>

36
00:02:36.601 --> 00:02:38.700
<i>And even
when the answer's "no"</i>

37
00:02:38.801 --> 00:02:40.600
<i>Or when my money's
running low,</i>

38
00:02:40.701 --> 00:02:42.900
<i>The dusty mic
and neon glow</i>

39
00:02:42.901 --> 00:02:44.300
<i>Are all I need</i>

40
00:02:44.301 --> 00:02:46.300
<i>And someday,
as I sing my song,</i>

41
00:02:46.401 --> 00:02:48.300
<i>A small-town kid'll
come along</i>

42
00:02:48.401 --> 00:02:52.100
<i>That'll be the thing to push him on
and go, go</i>

43
00:02:52.201 --> 00:02:55.600
<i>Climb these hills
I'm reaching for the heights</i>

44
00:02:55.701 --> 00:02:59.400
<i>And chasing
all the lights that shine</i>

45
00:02:59.501 --> 00:03:03.200
<i>And when they let you down,
(It's another day of...)</i>

46
00:03:03.301 --> 00:03:07.100
<i>You get up off the ground,
('Cause it's another day of...)</i>

47
00:03:07.201 --> 00:03:14.200
<i>'Cause morning rolls around
and it's another day of sun</i>

48
00:03:45.401 --> 00:03:49.200
<i>And when they let you down,</i>

49
00:03:49.301 --> 00:03:52.200
<i>The morning rolls around</i>

50
00:03:52.201 --> 00:03:55.900
<i>It's another day of sun
(Oh)</i>

51
00:03:56.001 --> 00:03:59.800
<i>It's another day of sun
(Oh)</i>

52
00:03:59.901 --> 00:04:03.100
<i>It's another day of sun
(Sun [...])</i>

53
00:04:03.201 --> 00:04:06.800
<i>It's another day of sun
(Oh)</i>

54
00:04:06.901 --> 00:04:10.900
<i>Just another day of sun
(Oh)</i>

55
00:04:11.001 --> 00:04:14.600
<i>It's another day of sun
(Sun)</i>

56
00:04:14.701 --> 00:04:20.200
<i>Another day has just begun
(Oh)</i>

57
00:04:20.201 --> 00:04:22.900
<i>It's another day of sun</i>

58
00:04:39.201 --> 00:04:41.400
<i>It's another day of sun</i>

00:04:50.201 --> 00:04:53.200
WINTER

60
00:04:53.301 --> 00:04:55.800
[...] already has won three Oscars,

61
00:04:55.801 --> 00:05:00.600
including for the 1998 film
"Shakespeare in Love".

62
00:05:25.101 --> 00:05:28.700
[...] I mean, we could not
believe what was happening.

63
00:05:28.801 --> 00:05:32.700
No, I swear to God.
She was wrecked!

64
00:05:32.801 --> 00:05:36.000
She was completely wrecked!
I know!

65
00:05:36.101 --> 00:05:40.400
I know, it-it was...
it was pure insanity.

66
00:05:40.401 --> 00:05:42.800
"It's insanity?"

67
00:05:42.901 --> 00:05:44.300
Ah!

68
00:05:44.401 --> 00:05:47.800
Lunacy! "It was pure lunacy."

69
00:05:57.501 --> 00:06:00.000
What is his problem?
I should go.

70
00:06:07.801 --> 00:06:10.200
- Cappuccino, please.
- Right, of course.

71
00:06:10.301 --> 00:06:14.400
- On us.
- Oh! No, thank you. I insist.

72
00:06:25.601 --> 00:06:28.600
Did you see who that was?

73
00:06:43.501 --> 00:06:44.800
Audition!

74
00:06:45.601 --> 00:06:47.000
Shit.

75
00:06:47.301 --> 00:06:48.700
Mia, where d'you think
you're going?

76
00:06:48.701 --> 00:06:50.000
Oh. To see a doctor.

77
00:06:50.001 --> 00:06:51.700
You better be here
early tomorrow.

78
00:06:51.701 --> 00:06:53.100
Okay.

79
00:06:53.801 --> 00:06:55.700
Have a good night!

80
00:07:09.401 --> 00:07:11.900
She was wrecked!

81
00:07:11.901 --> 00:07:13.900
It was pure lunacy!
It was...

82
00:07:13.901 --> 00:07:16.800
It was so crazy and I just...

83
00:07:16.901 --> 00:07:19.300
Oh, you would've died.

84
00:07:20.301 --> 00:07:24.400
No, Turner's fine. Turner's fine.
I-I just, uh...

85
00:07:25.201 --> 00:07:28.800
Are you going to wait until Denver
to tell her, or...?

86
00:07:31.801 --> 00:07:33.600
What?

87
00:07:42.301 --> 00:07:44.200
Okay.

88
00:07:48.701 --> 00:07:51.100
No, I'm happy for you.

89
00:07:53.101 --> 00:07:55.800
I am, I'm happy for you.
I just...

90
00:07:58.201 --> 00:08:00.400
I just thought...

91
00:08:03.501 --> 00:08:05.100
- I don't know what I thought.
- One second.

92
00:08:05.101 --> 00:08:06.100
I guess it just [...]

93
00:08:07.901 --> 00:08:10.500
- What, Ruby?
- Jessica on the phone.

94
00:08:10.601 --> 00:08:14.900
- Uh... Tell her I'll call her back.
- In two minutes?

95
00:08:15.201 --> 00:08:16.300
Less than two minutes.

96
00:08:16.301 --> 00:08:19.500
- I'll go get your lunch.
- I'm almost done. Thank you.

97
00:08:27.301 --> 00:08:30.000
Oh. You know what?
I think we're good.

98
00:08:30.001 --> 00:08:31.900
Thanks for coming in.

99
00:09:34.701 --> 00:09:37.800
Wow! Holy shit!
You wanna open a window?

100
00:09:37.901 --> 00:09:39.500
It was trying to give you
an entrance.

101
00:09:39.501 --> 00:09:40.800
Thank you.

102
00:09:40.901 --> 00:09:43.800
Mia! How'd the audition go?!

103
00:09:44.101 --> 00:09:45.800
- Er...
- Er, same here.

104
00:09:45.801 --> 00:09:47.200
Was Jen there? Or Rachel?

105
00:09:47.201 --> 00:09:48.900
I don't know
who Jen and Rachel are.

106
00:09:48.901 --> 00:09:50.100
Are the worst.

107
00:09:50.101 --> 00:09:52.100
Oh, I don't know
if they were there.

108
00:09:52.101 --> 00:09:53.200
Bet that they were.

109
00:09:53.201 --> 00:09:55.300
Why is there a convention
in the bathroom?

110
00:09:55.301 --> 00:09:56.300
Agreed.

111
00:09:56.301 --> 00:09:59.200
Two minutes, people!
Mia, you're coming, right?!

112
00:09:59.201 --> 00:10:00.700
I can't!

113
00:10:00.801 --> 00:10:01.900
I'm working.

114
00:10:02.001 --> 00:10:03.200
What?!

115
00:10:03.501 --> 00:10:05.800
Did she just say "working"?

116
00:10:07.101 --> 00:10:09.000
- What?
- I'm sorry it didn't go well today,

117
00:10:09.101 --> 00:10:10.400
and there's like four things
in my inbox

118
00:10:10.501 --> 00:10:12.300
that you're perfect for
and I will submit you.

119
00:10:12.301 --> 00:10:14.300
But right now, you're coming!

120
00:10:14.301 --> 00:10:16.500
- It will be fun.
- It's not gonna be fun.

121
00:10:16.601 --> 00:10:18.000
- It could be.
- It's not.

122
00:10:18.101 --> 00:10:20.000
It's gonna be a bunch
of social climbers,

123
00:10:20.101 --> 00:10:22.500
all packed into one
of those big glass houses.

124
00:10:22.501 --> 00:10:24.100
This looks familiar.

125
00:10:24.101 --> 00:10:26.500
- I was gonna give that back.
- How long have you had this?!

126
00:10:26.601 --> 00:10:28.500
- Oh, a long time.
- Come on, Mia!

127
00:10:28.601 --> 00:10:29.700
When else
are you gonna get to see

128
00:10:29.801 --> 00:10:32.200
a very Hollywood cliche
crammed into the same room?

129
00:10:32.201 --> 00:10:34.000
We'll make fun of it together!

130
00:10:34.001 --> 00:10:36.800
"I'm disappointed in you, Lex."
There's nothing to make fun of.

131
00:10:36.901 --> 00:10:39.700
This party is gonna be like...
humanity at its finest.

132
00:10:39.701 --> 00:10:40.700
Hmm.

133
00:10:40.701 --> 00:10:44.200
<i>- You got the invitation
- You got the right address</i>

134
00:10:44.301 --> 00:10:48.000
<i>- You need some medication?
- The answer's always yes</i>

135
00:10:48.001 --> 00:10:50.100
<i>A little chance encounter</i>

136
00:10:50.101 --> 00:10:52.500
<i>Could be the one
you've waited for</i>

137
00:10:52.501 --> 00:10:53.500
Oh!

138
00:10:53.601 --> 00:10:55.600
<i>Just squeeze a bit more!</i>

139
00:10:55.601 --> 00:10:59.200
<i>Tonight we're on a mission
Tonight's the casting call</i>

140
00:10:59.201 --> 00:11:01.200
<i>If this is the real audition</i>

141
00:11:01.301 --> 00:11:03.000
<i>Oh, God help us all!</i>

142
00:11:03.001 --> 00:11:08.200
<i>You make the right impression,
Then ev'rybody knows your name</i>

143
00:11:08.201 --> 00:11:10.400
<i>We're in the fast lane</i>

144
00:11:10.401 --> 00:11:14.000
<i>Someone in the crowd could be
the one you need to know,</i>

145
00:11:14.101 --> 00:11:17.800
<i>The one to fin'lly
lift you off the ground</i>

146
00:11:17.901 --> 00:11:21.300
<i>Someone in the crowd
could take you where you wanna go</i>

147
00:11:21.401 --> 00:11:23.900
<i>If you're the someone
ready to be found</i>

148
00:11:24.001 --> 00:11:26.400
<i>The someone
ready to be found</i>

149
00:11:26.501 --> 00:11:30.200
<i>Do what you need to do
'til they discover you</i>

150
00:11:30.301 --> 00:11:34.000
<i>And make you more
than who you're seeing now</i>

151
00:11:34.101 --> 00:11:37.900
<i>- So with the stars aligned
- I think I'll stay behind</i>

152
00:11:37.901 --> 00:11:42.400
<i>You've got to go and find</i>

153
00:11:43.001 --> 00:11:45.800
<i>That someone in the crowd</i>

154
00:12:11.701 --> 00:12:13.200
Hey girl!

155
00:12:13.301 --> 00:12:15.000
Uhuh.

156
00:12:15.301 --> 00:12:19.400
<i>That someone in the crowd!</i>

157
00:13:27.301 --> 00:13:30.800
<i>Is someone in the crowd</i>

158
00:13:30.801 --> 00:13:35.400
<i>the only thing
you really see?</i>

159
00:13:36.101 --> 00:13:43.900
<i>Watching while the world
keeps spinning 'round?</i>

160
00:13:44.701 --> 00:13:53.300
<i>Somewhere there's a place
where I find who I'm gonna be,</i>

161
00:13:54.201 --> 00:13:56.300
<i>A somewhere</i>

162
00:13:56.301 --> 00:14:02.800
<i>that's just waiting
to be found</i>

163
00:14:49.001 --> 00:14:52.200

00:15:21.701 --> 00:15:25.000
Oh, come on! What...?

173
00:15:28.101 --> 00:15:30.000
Ah!

174
00:15:51.901 --> 00:15:56.000
STORAGE / ENTRANCE

175
00:16:49.701 --> 00:16:52.800
Lipton's / OPEN

176
00:17:55.601 --> 00:17:57.500
California oranges

177
00:18:00.901 --> 00:18:04.400
VAN BEEK - Tapas & Tunes

178
00:18:17.601 --> 00:18:19.200
Please stop sneaking
into my home.

179
00:18:19.301 --> 00:18:21.200
D'you think Mom and Dad
would call this a "home"?

180
00:18:21.201 --> 00:18:22.500
What're you doing?

181
00:18:22.501 --> 00:18:24.500
Please don't do that.
Please don't sit on that.

182
00:18:24.601 --> 00:18:25.900
- Are you kidding?
- Please don't sit on that,

183
00:18:26.001 --> 00:18:27.400
don't sit on that.
Don't sit on that.

184
00:18:27.501 --> 00:18:29.200
- Hoagy Carmichael sat on that.
- Oh my God!

185
00:18:29.301 --> 00:18:30.700
The Baked Potato
just threw it away.

186
00:18:30.701 --> 00:18:31.800
I can't imagine why.

187
00:18:31.801 --> 00:18:34.400
- And now you're just sitting on it.
- I got you a throw rug.

188
00:18:34.401 --> 00:18:35.700
I don't need that.

189
00:18:35.701 --> 00:18:38.400
What if I said
Miles Davis pissed on it?

190
00:18:38.401 --> 00:18:40.300
It's almost insulting.

191
00:18:40.401 --> 00:18:41.500
Is it true?

192
00:18:41.501 --> 00:18:44.100
When are you going
to unpack these boxes?!

193
00:18:44.201 --> 00:18:45.900
When I unpack them
in my own club.

194
00:18:45.901 --> 00:18:46.900
Oh, Sebastian!

195
00:18:46.901 --> 00:18:49.500
It's like a girl broke up
with you and you're stalking her.

196
00:18:49.601 --> 00:18:52.000
You're not still going by there,
are you?

197
00:18:52.001 --> 00:18:53.900
That's...

198
00:18:54.201 --> 00:18:56.000
Can't believe it, they turned it
into a samba-tapas place.

199
00:18:56.101 --> 00:19:00.000
- Oh my God, Sebastian!
- Samba, tapas.

200
00:19:00.101 --> 00:19:02.600
Pick one, you know?
Do one right.

201
00:19:02.701 --> 00:19:04.600
I have someone
I want you to meet.

202
00:19:04.601 --> 00:19:06.700
I don't want to meet anyone.

203
00:19:06.701 --> 00:19:07.500
No, no,
I don't want to meet anyone.

204
00:19:07.601 --> 00:19:08.700
- Dad gave you this?
- Yes.

205
00:19:08.701 --> 00:19:10.000
You'll like her.

206
00:19:10.101 --> 00:19:11.700
I don't think I'm gonna like her.

207
00:19:11.701 --> 00:19:13.500
- Does she like jazz?
- Probably not.

208
00:19:13.601 --> 00:19:15.000
Then what are we gonna
talk about?

209
00:19:15.101 --> 00:19:16.500
I dont know! It doesn't matter,
okay?

210
00:19:16.601 --> 00:19:19.500
Because you're living like a hermit.
You're driving without insurance!

211
00:19:19.601 --> 00:19:21.100
- It doesn't matter?
- Yeah, it doesn't matter.

212
00:19:21.201 --> 00:19:22.500
- Okay.
- You need to get serious.

213
00:19:22.601 --> 00:19:24.600
Well, then I know a guy with
a face tattoo that you should see.

214
00:19:24.701 --> 00:19:26.400
- Okay, low blow.
- With a heart of gold.

215
00:19:26.501 --> 00:19:28.200
- Get serious!
- Get serious? Laura.

216
00:19:28.301 --> 00:19:31.900
I... I had a very serious plan
for my future.

217
00:19:31.901 --> 00:19:33.000
I know.

218
00:19:33.001 --> 00:19:34.400
It's not my fault
I got shanghaied!

219
00:19:34.501 --> 00:19:37.500
You didn't get shanghaied,
you got ripped off.

220
00:19:37.501 --> 00:19:38.800
What's the difference?

221
00:19:38.801 --> 00:19:41.900
I don't know!
It's not as romantic as that.

222
00:19:41.901 --> 00:19:43.500
Don't sit...

223
00:19:44.201 --> 00:19:47.500
Everybody knew that guy
was shady, except for you.

224
00:19:47.901 --> 00:19:51.400
Why do you say "romantic"
like it's a dirty word?

225
00:19:51.501 --> 00:19:55.500
Unpaid bills are not romantic.
Call her.

226
00:19:55.501 --> 00:19:56.700
I'm not going to call her.

227
00:19:56.701 --> 00:20:00.300
The thing is... y-you're acting like
life's got me on the ropes.

228
00:20:00.301 --> 00:20:02.400
I want to be on the ropes.

229
00:20:02.401 --> 00:20:04.900
Okay? I'm just... I'm letting
life hit me until it gets tired.

230
00:20:04.901 --> 00:20:05.900
Oh?

231
00:20:05.901 --> 00:20:09.500
Then I'm gonna hit back.
It's a classic "rope-a-dope".

232
00:20:09.901 --> 00:20:11.300
Okay, Ali.

233
00:20:11.301 --> 00:20:13.200
I love you.
Unpack the boxes.

234
00:20:13.301 --> 00:20:16.400
- I'm gonna change the locks.
- You can't afford it.

235
00:20:17.101 --> 00:20:20.700
I'm a phoenix
rising from the ashes!

236
00:20:24.401 --> 00:20:25.600
PAST DUE

237
00:21:07.701 --> 00:21:09.100
- Hey.
- Hey Bill.

238
00:21:09.201 --> 00:21:10.800
- Thanks for letting me back.
- You're welcome.

239
00:21:10.901 --> 00:21:12.500
I want you to know
that you're looking at a new man.

240
00:21:12.501 --> 00:21:13.500
Good.

241
00:21:13.501 --> 00:21:15.000
- A man that's happy to be here.
- Excellent.

242
00:21:15.101 --> 00:21:16.600
- Very-easy-to-work-with man.
- Okay.

243
00:21:16.701 --> 00:21:18.300
And you're gonna...
play the setlist?

244
00:21:18.301 --> 00:21:19.800
Happy to.

245
00:21:19.801 --> 00:21:21.700
Even though I don't think
anybody cares what I play,

246
00:21:21.801 --> 00:21:23.200
- but yeah.
- Yep. Well,

247
00:21:23.301 --> 00:21:25.500
if by "anyone" you mean
anyone other than me,

248
00:21:25.501 --> 00:21:26.500
that would be correct.

249
00:21:26.501 --> 00:21:28.000
I care, and I don't wanna hear
the free jazz.

250
00:21:28.001 --> 00:21:30.300
Right. Okay.

251
00:21:30.301 --> 00:21:32.100
Although I-I... I thought
that in this town

252
00:21:32.201 --> 00:21:35.400
it worked on a sort of "one
for you, one for me" type system.

253
00:21:35.801 --> 00:21:38.200
How about two for you,
one for me?

254
00:21:38.601 --> 00:21:40.500
How 'bout... all for you
and none for me?

255
00:21:40.601 --> 00:21:42.000
- That's perfect. Yes.
- Great.

256
00:21:42.101 --> 00:21:43.600
- Okay.
- Okay. Mutual decision.

257
00:21:43.701 --> 00:21:45.700
- Right. Made-Made by me.
- Right.

258
00:21:45.701 --> 00:21:47.500
And I... signed off on it, so...

259
00:21:47.501 --> 00:21:50.100
Whatever. Tell yourself
what you wanna know.

260
00:21:50.101 --> 00:21:53.000
Well, welcome back.

261
00:21:53.701 --> 00:21:56.400
There's a nice way
to say that, Karen.

262
00:24:59.201 --> 00:25:00.900
Seb.

263
00:25:12.801 --> 00:25:14.500
I do-I-I hear
what you're saying,

264
00:25:14.601 --> 00:25:15.800
but I don't think
you're saying what you mean.

265
00:25:15.901 --> 00:25:18.000
Yeah, I don't think you hear
what I'm saying. You're fired.

266
00:25:18.101 --> 00:25:20.100
Well, I-That's what you're saying,
but it's not what you mean.

267
00:25:20.101 --> 00:25:21.100
What you mean is...

268
00:25:21.201 --> 00:25:22.300
You're fired.

269
00:25:22.401 --> 00:25:24.500
..."play the setlist".

270
00:25:24.501 --> 00:25:25.700
No, I'm saying
it's too late.

271
00:25:25.701 --> 00:25:26.900
It's a warning.

272
00:25:26.901 --> 00:25:28.300
What-What planet
are you from?

273
00:25:28.401 --> 00:25:29.400
- Don't fire me.
- You're done.

274
00:25:29.501 --> 00:25:31.500
- Don't fire me.
- I'm sorry, Seb.

275
00:25:31.501 --> 00:25:32.800
It's Christmas.

276
00:25:32.801 --> 00:25:36.500
Yeah, I see the decorations.
Good luck in the New Year.

277
00:25:49.801 --> 00:25:52.000
I just heard you play,
and I wanted to...

278
00:26:06.501 --> 00:26:09.300
I don't like the fissure
on the GT scan.

279
00:26:09.301 --> 00:26:11.600
Did you test for achromatopsia?

280
00:26:11.601 --> 00:26:15.100
D.O.A. on 23rd. Perp
laughing his face off at the P.D.

281
00:26:15.101 --> 00:26:16.700
Damn Miranda Rights.

282
00:26:16.801 --> 00:26:18.800
This is my classroom.

283
00:26:18.801 --> 00:26:21.000
You don't like it,
the door's to my left.

284
00:26:21.101 --> 00:26:23.900
Lady, why you be trippin'
like that?

285
00:26:23.901 --> 00:26:26.000
No, Jamal.

286
00:26:26.401 --> 00:26:29.100
You be trippin'.

287
00:26:33.001 --> 00:26:37.500
SPRING

288
00:26:37.601 --> 00:26:39.600
Jump right here!

289
00:26:41.901 --> 00:26:45.100
<i>We're talking away</i>

290
00:26:45.101 --> 00:26:47.800
<i>I don't know
what I'm to say,</i>

291
00:26:47.801 --> 00:26:48.800
<i>I'll say it anyway</i>

292
00:26:48.901 --> 00:26:50.200
Oh. Mia!

293
00:26:50.201 --> 00:26:52.400
- Hi!
- Hi.

294
00:26:52.501 --> 00:26:54.200
I want you to meet
my friend Carlo.

295
00:26:54.301 --> 00:26:55.600
- Hi. Carlo.
- Carlo, this is Mia.

296
00:26:55.701 --> 00:26:57.100
- Nice. Mia?
- Yes, Mia.

297
00:26:57.201 --> 00:26:59.100
- Hi. How are you?
- Carlo is a writer.

298
00:26:59.201 --> 00:27:01.600
Yeah. They say I have a knack
for world-building.

299
00:27:01.601 --> 00:27:03.100
I-I got a lot of heat right now.

300
00:27:03.101 --> 00:27:05.400
There's been a lot of buzz, people
talkin' about me, which is exciting.

301
00:27:05.501 --> 00:27:07.000
I mean, you work so hard,
and then all that validation.

302
00:27:07.101 --> 00:27:08.100
- It's great...
- I'm gonna grab a drink.

303
00:27:08.201 --> 00:27:09.200
- Yeah.
- Okay.

304
00:27:09.301 --> 00:27:10.600
- Okay.
- It's really nice to meet you...

305
00:27:10.701 --> 00:27:21.300
<i>I'll be gone
in a day or two</i>

306
00:27:21.401 --> 00:27:26.300
<i>So needless to say
I'm odds and ends,</i>

307
00:27:26.301 --> 00:27:30.300
<i>But I'll be stumbling away,</i>

308
00:27:30.301 --> 00:27:33.500
<i>Slowly learning
that life is okay</i>

309
00:27:33.501 --> 00:27:36.200
<i>Say after me:</i>

310
00:27:36.201 --> 00:27:38.900
<i>"It's no better to be safe
than sorry"</i>

311
00:27:38.901 --> 00:27:44.500
<i>Take on me (Take on me)</i>

312
00:27:44.601 --> 00:27:50.200
<i>Take me on (Take on me)</i>

313
00:27:50.201 --> 00:28:01.300
<i>I'll be gone
in a day or two</i>

314
00:28:01.301 --> 00:28:02.500
Thank you.

315
00:28:02.601 --> 00:28:05.000
Any other requests?!

316
00:28:07.401 --> 00:28:08.900
Girl in the front!

317
00:28:09.001 --> 00:28:10.000
"I Ran".

318
00:28:10.001 --> 00:28:13.600
"I Ran".
A fantastic suggestion!

319
00:28:13.701 --> 00:28:16.900
All right, piano man,
tickle those ivories. Let's hit it.

320
00:28:16.901 --> 00:28:19.600
One, two, three, four!

321
00:28:25.901 --> 00:28:27.200
Uh!

322
00:28:30.001 --> 00:28:31.500
That's right!

323
00:28:31.601 --> 00:28:34.800
<i>I walk alone the avenue</i>

324
00:28:34.801 --> 00:28:39.500
<i>I never thought I'd meet
a girl like you</i>

325
00:28:39.501 --> 00:28:42.000
<i>Meet a girl like you</i>

326
00:28:42.101 --> 00:28:43.800
(Me?)

327
00:28:44.501 --> 00:28:47.700
<i>With auburn hair
and tawny eyes,</i>

328
00:28:47.801 --> 00:28:52.200
<i>With kind of eyes
that hypnotize me through</i>

329
00:28:52.201 --> 00:28:56.400
<i>That hypnotize me through</i>

330
00:28:56.401 --> 00:29:02.300
<i>And I ran,
I ran so far away</i>

331
00:29:02.301 --> 00:29:04.900
<i>I couldn't get away</i>

332
00:29:15.201 --> 00:29:21.200
<i>Sometimes I feel
I've got to run away,</i>

333
00:29:21.201 --> 00:29:24.500
<i>I've got to get away</i>

334
00:29:24.501 --> 00:29:29.800
<i>From the pain you drive
into the heart of me</i>

335
00:29:29.801 --> 00:29:31.800
All right. I remember you.

336
00:29:31.801 --> 00:29:34.600
And I'll admit I was
a little curt that night.

337
00:29:34.701 --> 00:29:36.500
- "Curt"?
- Okay, I was an asshole.

338
00:29:36.601 --> 00:29:38.400
- I can admit that.
- Okay.

339
00:29:38.501 --> 00:29:41.000
But requesting "I Ran"
from a serious musician

340
00:29:41.001 --> 00:29:42.200
is just... it's too far.

341
00:29:42.201 --> 00:29:45.800
My Lord! Did you just say
"a serious musician"?

342
00:29:45.801 --> 00:29:46.800
I don't think so.

343
00:29:46.801 --> 00:29:48.400
- Can I borrow what you're wearing?
- Why?

344
00:29:48.501 --> 00:29:49.700
'Cause I have an audition
next week.

345
00:29:49.801 --> 00:29:51.800
I'm playing
a serious firefighter.

346
00:29:51.801 --> 00:29:53.000
So you're an actress.

347
00:29:53.001 --> 00:29:55.600
I thought you looked familiar.
Have I seen you on anything?

348
00:29:55.701 --> 00:29:58.900
Uh... A coffee shop?
On the Warner Bros. lot?

349
00:29:59.001 --> 00:30:00.600
- That's classic.
- Oh, I see.

350
00:30:00.701 --> 00:30:01.800
- Yeah.
- You're a barista.

351
00:30:01.901 --> 00:30:04.000
And I can see how you could then
look down on me

352
00:30:04.001 --> 00:30:05.200
from all the way up there.

353
00:30:05.301 --> 00:30:07.200
Time to do the next set.

354
00:30:08.301 --> 00:30:10.100
He doesn't... I don't...

355
00:30:10.401 --> 00:30:11.900
He doesn't tell me
what to do.

356
00:30:12.001 --> 00:30:13.400
He just... told you
what to do...

357
00:30:13.401 --> 00:30:15.500
I know, he... I let him.

358
00:30:15.501 --> 00:30:16.900
- What's your name?
- Mia.

359
00:30:16.901 --> 00:30:18.400
Mia.

360
00:30:19.501 --> 00:30:21.800
Guess I'll see you
in the movies.

361
00:30:23.801 --> 00:30:25.600
- Heard of Joseph Campbell?
- Uh, yeah.

362
00:30:25.701 --> 00:30:27.200
I have this idea
to do a re-imagining

363
00:30:27.301 --> 00:30:30.000
of "Goldilocks and the Three Bears"
but from the perspective of the bears.

364
00:30:30.101 --> 00:30:32.200
It's kind of thrilling.
Yeah, it could be like a franchise.

365
00:30:32.301 --> 00:30:33.300
- Right.
- So we don't know.

366
00:30:33.401 --> 00:30:34.900
There could've been a fourth bear,
we don't know.

367
00:30:34.901 --> 00:30:36.800
George Michael!

368
00:30:42.001 --> 00:30:43.000
Hello.

369
00:30:43.001 --> 00:30:43.900
- Sorry.
- Yeah, yeah.

370
00:30:43.901 --> 00:30:45.300
It's... I know that guy.

371
00:30:45.401 --> 00:30:47.500
Did you get your keys?

372
00:30:49.001 --> 00:30:50.400
Mm-hmm. Yes.

373
00:30:50.501 --> 00:30:52.200
Can you grab mine?

374
00:30:52.301 --> 00:30:53.300
Can I what?

375
00:30:53.301 --> 00:30:54.500
Would you be able to grab mine?
My keys?

376
00:30:54.601 --> 00:30:55.600
- I can't hear you.
- Sorry.

377
00:30:55.701 --> 00:30:58.700
- Can-Can you grab my keys?
- Oh.

378
00:30:58.801 --> 00:31:00.000
- Please?
- Oh, there we go.

379
00:31:00.101 --> 00:31:02.400
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

380
00:31:04.101 --> 00:31:06.700
- What kind?
- It's a Prius.

381
00:31:08.501 --> 00:31:10.300
That mean the...
That does't help me.

382
00:31:10.301 --> 00:31:12.100
With a green ribbon.

383
00:31:12.201 --> 00:31:13.600
All right.

384
00:31:15.601 --> 00:31:18.700
Those look, uh, comfortable.

385
00:31:18.801 --> 00:31:20.600
They are.

386
00:31:21.401 --> 00:31:24.200
Thank you for saving the day
back there.

387
00:31:25.801 --> 00:31:29.300
Well, you didn't really give me
much of a choice.

388
00:31:29.401 --> 00:31:32.700
It's pretty strange that we keep
running into each other.

389
00:31:32.801 --> 00:31:36.700
It is strange.
Maybe it means something.

390
00:31:36.801 --> 00:31:38.100
- I doubt it.
- Yeah, I don't think so.

391
00:31:38.101 --> 00:31:40.000
Where's my car?!

392
00:31:40.401 --> 00:31:42.500
You gotta put that thing
to your chin.

393
00:31:42.601 --> 00:31:44.600
- This?
- Yeah.

394
00:31:45.001 --> 00:31:46.700
Yeah, it makes your head
into an antenna, so...

395
00:31:46.701 --> 00:31:47.700
Oh?

396
00:31:47.701 --> 00:31:49.300
I think it gives you cancer,
but you find your car faster.

397
00:31:49.301 --> 00:31:50.300
What?

398
00:31:50.301 --> 00:31:52.100
I mean, you don't live as long,
but you get where you're going quicker,

399
00:31:52.201 --> 00:31:54.300
- so it all evens out.
- That sounds terrible.

400
00:31:54.401 --> 00:31:56.900
- Just a suggestion.
- You're a...

401
00:31:57.201 --> 00:31:59.200
You're a real, uh...

402
00:31:59.201 --> 00:32:01.400
- What's the word am I looking for?
- Knight in shining armor?

403
00:32:01.501 --> 00:32:05.100
- Weirdo. That was the word.
- Okay.

404
00:32:11.501 --> 00:32:13.700
Not much to look at, huh?

405
00:32:14.001 --> 00:32:15.900
I've seen better.

406
00:32:23.401 --> 00:32:27.500
<i>The sun is nearly gone,</i>

407
00:32:27.601 --> 00:32:32.400
<i>The lights are turnin' on,</i>

408
00:32:32.401 --> 00:32:39.000
<i>A silver shine
that stretches to the sea</i>

409
00:32:40.301 --> 00:32:43.300
<i>We've stumbled on a view</i>

410
00:32:43.401 --> 00:32:48.800
<i>That's tailor-made for two</i>

411
00:32:48.801 --> 00:32:54.700
<i>What a shame those two
are you and me</i>

412
00:32:55.701 --> 00:33:00.500
<i>Some other girl and guy</i>

413
00:33:00.601 --> 00:33:03.400
<i>Would love this swirling sky,</i>

414
00:33:03.501 --> 00:33:07.600
<i>But there's only you and I</i>

415
00:33:07.701 --> 00:33:11.400
<i>And we've got no shot</i>

416
00:33:11.501 --> 00:33:14.800
<i>This could never be</i>

417
00:33:14.801 --> 00:33:17.700
<i>- You're not the type for me
- Really?</i>

418
00:33:17.801 --> 00:33:22.100
<i>And there's not a spark
in sight</i>

419
00:33:22.201 --> 00:33:27.800
<i>What a waste
of a lovely night</i>

420
00:33:29.001 --> 00:33:30.700
<i>You say
there's nothing here?</i>

421
00:33:30.701 --> 00:33:32.500
<i>Well, let's make something clear</i>

422
00:33:32.501 --> 00:33:35.100
<i>I think I'll be the one
to make that call</i>

423
00:33:35.101 --> 00:33:36.100
But you'll call?

424
00:33:36.101 --> 00:33:38.800
<i>And though you looked so cute
in your polyester suit,</i>

425
00:33:38.801 --> 00:33:39.800
It's wool.

426
00:33:39.801 --> 00:33:42.500
<i>You're right,
I'd never fall for you at all</i>

427
00:33:42.501 --> 00:33:45.800
<i>And maybe this appeals</i>

428
00:33:45.901 --> 00:33:48.700
<i>To someone not in heels</i>

429
00:33:48.801 --> 00:33:52.800
<i>Or to any girl who feels</i>

430
00:33:52.801 --> 00:33:56.300
<i>There's some chance
for romance</i>

431
00:33:56.401 --> 00:33:59.000
<i>But, I'm frankly
feeling nothing</i>

432
00:33:59.001 --> 00:34:00.200
<i>Is that so?</i>

433
00:34:00.201 --> 00:34:02.100
<i>Or it could be
less than nothing</i>

434
00:34:02.201 --> 00:34:05.000
<i>Good to know,
so you agree?</i>

435
00:34:05.001 --> 00:34:06.300
<i>That's right</i>

436
00:34:06.301 --> 00:34:10.600
<i>What a waste
of a lovely night</i>

437
00:36:17.600 --> 00:36:19.300
Ah.

438
00:36:19.401 --> 00:36:21.000
Hi, Greg.

439
00:36:21.301 --> 00:36:23.400
Hi... Oh! Sorry, I'm late.

440
00:36:23.401 --> 00:36:26.600
Yeah. I'll be there soon.
Okay, bye.

441
00:36:46.501 --> 00:36:49.100
- It's... It's just right there.
- Just right here.

442
00:36:49.101 --> 00:36:50.600
Hmm.

443
00:36:54.501 --> 00:36:56.500
Do you want a ride
to your car?

444
00:36:57.301 --> 00:36:59.700
No, I'm just... right up here.

445
00:37:02.001 --> 00:37:03.800
Good night.

446
00:37:09.701 --> 00:37:11.100
Good night.

447
00:38:23.501 --> 00:38:26.800
Excuse me.
This is gluten-free, right?

448
00:38:27.201 --> 00:38:28.200
No.

449
00:38:28.301 --> 00:38:29.300
What?!

450
00:38:29.401 --> 00:38:30.400
Mm-mmm.

451
00:38:30.501 --> 00:38:32.800
What? I'd like a refund.

452
00:38:34.101 --> 00:38:37.300
Okay. Let me check on that for you.

453
00:38:38.101 --> 00:38:41.700
Mia? You're closing friday.

454
00:38:41.701 --> 00:38:44.600
I-I c-I can't close on friday.
I have an audition, remember?

455
00:38:44.701 --> 00:38:46.900
Do I look like I care?
Reschedule it.

456
00:38:47.001 --> 00:38:48.600
- Oh, and, uh, we need to have
- I...

457
00:38:48.601 --> 00:38:50.200
a little talk tomorrow, okay?

458
00:38:50.201 --> 00:38:53.900
- Fix your apron, please.
- Uh... Okay.

459
00:38:58.001 --> 00:38:59.700
You again!

460
00:39:01.601 --> 00:39:02.600
What're you doin' here?

461
00:39:02.601 --> 00:39:06.200
Oh, you know, just meetings
and... studio heads and...

462
00:39:06.201 --> 00:39:08.000
How'd you get on the lot?

463
00:39:08.001 --> 00:39:10.700
I basically just hauled ass
past the guard gates, so...

464
00:39:10.801 --> 00:39:13.600
I think I have 20 minutes
until they find me.

465
00:39:13.701 --> 00:39:15.500
You don't have a break...
coming up, do you?

466
00:39:15.501 --> 00:39:17.400
I'm off in 10 minutes. So...

467
00:39:18.701 --> 00:39:20.300
Can I hide in the bathroom?

468
00:39:20.301 --> 00:39:22.000
- Yes.
- Okay. (Thank you.)

469
00:39:23.601 --> 00:39:24.700
Sorry.

470
00:39:24.801 --> 00:39:26.200
Uh...

471
00:39:26.201 --> 00:39:28.600
I actually do have to check.
I'm... sorry.

472
00:39:32.101 --> 00:39:33.900
That's the window
that Humphrey Bogart

473
00:39:34.001 --> 00:39:35.800
and Ingrid Bergman
looked out of in Casablanca.

474
00:39:35.901 --> 00:39:37.100
- Wow!
- Yeah.

475
00:39:37.201 --> 00:39:39.100
I can't believe you work
right across the street from that.

476
00:39:39.201 --> 00:39:41.000
- Yeah.
- That's amazing.

477
00:39:41.101 --> 00:39:44.700
What was your, uh...,
your Bogart's name?

478
00:39:45.001 --> 00:39:47.200
What's his name?
Is it Greg?

479
00:39:47.201 --> 00:39:49.300
Yeah. Greg.

480
00:39:49.301 --> 00:39:52.000
Right. How long
have you, uh, been...?

481
00:39:52.101 --> 00:39:54.100
We've been seeing each other
for about a month.

482
00:39:54.101 --> 00:39:55.400
Uh, that's great.

483
00:39:55.501 --> 00:39:57.100
He's, uh... He's sweet.

484
00:39:57.101 --> 00:39:59.200
Anyway, I love being around
this stuff, you know?

485
00:39:59.301 --> 00:40:01.700
I know what you mean. I-I get coffee
5 miles out of the way

486
00:40:01.801 --> 00:40:04.400
- just so I can be near a jazz club.
- Really?

487
00:40:04.501 --> 00:40:05.800
Yeah, the Van Beek.
Do you know it?

488
00:40:05.801 --> 00:40:06.800
Mm-mmm.

489
00:40:06.801 --> 00:40:08.200
All the big swing bands
used to play there.

490
00:40:08.201 --> 00:40:10.300
Count Basie, Chick Webb.

491
00:40:11.001 --> 00:40:14.200
Anyway, it's a samba-tapas place
now, so...

492
00:40:14.901 --> 00:40:16.100
What's a samba-tapas place?

493
00:40:16.101 --> 00:40:18.400
You know, it's like a samba place
where they serve tapas.
