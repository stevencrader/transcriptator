1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,799
Alban: It is so stinking nice to
like, show up and record this

2
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:08,250
show. And Travis has already put
together an outline. Kevin's got

3
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:13,169
suggestions, I throw my thoughts
into the mix. And then Travis

4
00:00:13,169 --> 00:00:16,739
goes and does all the work from
there, too. It's out into the

5
00:00:16,739 --> 00:00:21,269
wild. And I don't see anything.
That's an absolute joy for at

6
00:00:21,269 --> 00:00:23,730
least two thirds of the team.
Yeah, I mean, exactly.

7
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,850
Kevin: You guys remember, like
two months ago, when you were

8
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:35,460
like, We're going all in on
video Buzzcast. I was like,

9
00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:39,119
that's, I mean, I will agree and
commit and disagree, disagree

10
00:00:39,119 --> 00:00:41,369
and commit, I'll do something.
But I don't want to do this.

11
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:48,240
Alban: I never said that. The
only reason we ever did video

12
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:49,619
was because of you.

13
00:00:50,308 --> 00:00:53,249
Kevin: That is true. I will take
that. Because when we first got

14
00:00:53,249 --> 00:00:55,978
locked down, and we weren't
allowed to see anybody in

15
00:00:55,978 --> 00:00:58,259
person, I was like, well, it
would be nice to be able to see

16
00:00:58,259 --> 00:01:00,598
you guys when we record. And if
we're going to be doing video

17
00:01:00,598 --> 00:01:04,049
chats Anyway, why don't we go
ahead and publish those. So I do

18
00:01:04,049 --> 00:01:06,748
take the full blame for moving
us to video in the first place.

19
00:01:07,948 --> 00:01:10,049
But how's that working out for
us?

20
00:01:11,519 --> 00:01:16,079
Alban: Not good. The first one
we did was like a year ago, we

21
00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:21,299
did that live stream to our
YouTube channel. And that just

22
00:01:21,299 --> 00:01:25,140
kind of grew into then we wanted
to play around with Riverside,

23
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:28,829
which was doing video remote
video recording, and then squad

24
00:01:28,829 --> 00:01:33,060
cast launched video, remote
video recording. And I think,

25
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:36,750
you know, we've you kind of had
the tools, the tools were there.

26
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:40,319
So we started playing with the
tools and experimenting. And now

27
00:01:40,319 --> 00:01:44,459
the experiment is coming to an
end, at least for now, at least

28
00:01:44,459 --> 00:01:49,379
for now. So do we want to give
like the whole story of it, kind

29
00:01:49,379 --> 00:01:53,040
of walk through why we made each
decision along the way? And

30
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,859
let's give the sparknotes what
we learned the highlights

31
00:01:56,010 --> 00:01:58,859
sparknotes? Yeah, start at the
beginning. Kevin, why did you

32
00:01:58,859 --> 00:02:01,079
want to start doing some video
Buzzcast.

33
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:03,359
Kevin: When we first started
recording Buzzcast, we would do

34
00:02:03,359 --> 00:02:07,260
it together in the office in our
little studio space. And we

35
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:11,879
could play off of each other's
energy, right? I think, Listen,

36
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:15,090
I'll speak for myself, I'm not a
super high energy person. So it

37
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:18,330
helps for me to be sitting
across the table for somebody or

38
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:21,000
to see somebody else's reactions
to what I'm saying or when

39
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,270
they're speaking themselves to
be able to keep myself amped up

40
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:26,789
and engaged in the conversation
when we went audio only and

41
00:02:26,789 --> 00:02:29,729
there was no video component, it
was hard for me to continue to

42
00:02:29,729 --> 00:02:32,669
keep my energy high. And to stay
engaged. I've also got a little

43
00:02:32,669 --> 00:02:34,919
bit of add that I'm I'm fighting
and dealing with at the same

44
00:02:34,919 --> 00:02:39,900
time. So that part was was
necessary in order to be able to

45
00:02:40,349 --> 00:02:43,439
just produce good content. What
I was interested in is that

46
00:02:43,439 --> 00:02:45,599
since we're doing this video
component Anyway, why don't we

47
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:48,210
record this, we've always said
that YouTube is an interesting

48
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:50,370
opportunity for people to
promote their podcasts because

49
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:52,139
they do have the algorithm, they
do have the recommendation

50
00:02:52,139 --> 00:02:56,009
engine. But you shouldn't just
publish your audio only there.

51
00:02:56,069 --> 00:02:58,409
Because that doesn't feed into
the strengths of the algorithm.

52
00:02:58,409 --> 00:03:00,840
So you're not even getting the
benefit. And you're taking all

53
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:04,050
this extra time to do that. In
fact, you could be you know,

54
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:05,759
putting yourself at a
disadvantage if you do that,

55
00:03:05,759 --> 00:03:08,189
because then you get a bad
reputation with the algorithm.

56
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:12,360
So anyway, we were doing video,
why not go ahead. And while we

57
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:14,699
edit the podcast, the audio
version, why not edit the video

58
00:03:14,699 --> 00:03:16,620
version and just stick it on
YouTube and see if we get a bump

59
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:20,729
from it. That is where you guys
come in on the analytical side

60
00:03:20,939 --> 00:03:24,870
and say, Is this working is this
not I will say that the

61
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:29,639
constraints from just somebody
who's on the podcast are much

62
00:03:29,639 --> 00:03:32,340
higher than I anticipated. It's
one thing when you're out of the

63
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:35,250
office, or if you're traveling
or you can't be here there to be

64
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:38,430
able to quickly grab a USB mic,
throw it in your bag go with

65
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:40,409
you. And you can record audio
from anywhere in the world, it's

66
00:03:40,409 --> 00:03:43,199
not too hard to find a quiet
space, most hotel rooms are

67
00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:45,240
pretty quiet. Or if you're
staying on Airbnb or something

68
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:47,400
that you can find a closet, you
can find a quiet space to record

69
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:52,979
audio, being able to travel with
a decent camera setup. Or if you

70
00:03:52,979 --> 00:03:54,479
don't have a decent camera
setup, then you're using

71
00:03:54,479 --> 00:03:57,539
whatever on your laptop, you're
constantly worried about your

72
00:03:57,539 --> 00:03:59,520
background, like all this stuff
is going on. It's just a

73
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:02,879
different level of commitment
and what's required in terms of

74
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,400
being able to put a show out
every week or every other week.

75
00:04:05,610 --> 00:04:12,000
So that has been added an extra
level of commitment to the show,

76
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:14,069
which again, not something that
we weren't willing to do, but

77
00:04:14,069 --> 00:04:16,529
something that was a little bit
unexpected. Didn't know going

78
00:04:16,529 --> 00:04:19,560
into it. And then from an
analytical side, like how

79
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:23,069
helpful was it actually, for us
growing the show? That's what

80
00:04:23,069 --> 00:04:24,240
you guys have dug into. Right?

81
00:04:24,449 --> 00:04:27,839
Alban: Yeah, I mean, we can talk
a bit about the analytics buzz

82
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:33,689
cast itself was getting more
attention, let's call it

83
00:04:33,689 --> 00:04:37,529
attention than it ever had
before. We were getting between

84
00:04:37,529 --> 00:04:45,029
the downloads that continued to
grow on the RSS side. And on the

85
00:04:45,029 --> 00:04:48,209
YouTube channel being added to
that it was huge. And then we

86
00:04:48,209 --> 00:04:52,920
started doing clips of Buzzcast
episodes. And those were doing

87
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:56,490
really well. And so if you
wanted to add all that up, it

88
00:04:56,490 --> 00:05:01,259
was like wow, this show is
doubled in sighs This is great.

89
00:05:02,399 --> 00:05:08,339
But we on the other side, were
kind of frustrated with the

90
00:05:08,339 --> 00:05:13,259
growth of the YouTube channel.
We grew a ton the first year.

91
00:05:13,769 --> 00:05:17,610
And we just kind of seen a lot
of slowing down of our growth.

92
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:22,050
We didn't know exactly why. And
we kept kind of digging into the

93
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:27,839
data. And I think it might have
been Jonathan first, or maybe it

94
00:05:27,839 --> 00:05:30,959
was Travis, who said, I just
clicked through all of the last

95
00:05:30,959 --> 00:05:35,189
videos. And I noticed most of
the Buzzcast ones lose

96
00:05:35,189 --> 00:05:39,779
subscribers. And I was like,
That's not true. And then I

97
00:05:39,779 --> 00:05:43,709
click through and went, Oh,
that's definitely true. I was

98
00:05:43,709 --> 00:05:48,089
very skeptical by nature. And so
and then we started digging in

99
00:05:48,089 --> 00:05:54,779
deeper. And I took, I think it
was like six different stats

100
00:05:54,779 --> 00:05:58,500
that we use to kind of quantify
how valuable each individual

101
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:03,300
video is. And I just went back
and looked at, like the last 90

102
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:05,519
days, all the videos that were
created during that 90 day

103
00:06:05,519 --> 00:06:12,480
period, I think we had 22
videos, or 26 videos, all of the

104
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:15,540
Buzzcast ones were in the worst
category, they were they

105
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:20,490
represented, like the very
bottom five episodes, or videos.

106
00:06:20,970 --> 00:06:25,170
And, you know, we, I think
Travis, you had some good ideas

107
00:06:25,170 --> 00:06:29,550
of why the Buzzcast ones were
performing near the bottom. But

108
00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:32,699
in the end, we were kind of
doing the thing that we've

109
00:06:32,699 --> 00:06:34,620
always criticized, we've always
criticized people who were

110
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:39,990
putting a static image on a
YouTube video on a YouTube

111
00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:44,790
video, just having audio, you
know, we said that can crush an

112
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:49,740
existing valuable YouTube
channel. And we were crushing

113
00:06:49,769 --> 00:06:55,500
our existing value bowl YouTube
channel, by adding this, you

114
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:59,550
know, some of this, basically
podcast content in video format.

115
00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:01,800
Kevin: To clarify, we weren't
crushing it because we weren't

116
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:05,160
putting the static image when we
were putting real video up. But

117
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:09,269
we weren't playing in line with
the the rules of YouTube or to

118
00:07:09,269 --> 00:07:11,519
use the algorithm in the
smartest and best way we were

119
00:07:11,519 --> 00:07:14,100
confusing the algorithm. We were
publishing different lengths of

120
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:17,550
content, different formats of
content. And so we ended up is a

121
00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:20,459
very important and valuable
channel for us for marketing our

122
00:07:20,459 --> 00:07:22,769
software and telling the world
about what Buzzsprout can do for

123
00:07:22,769 --> 00:07:26,220
you as a podcaster. We were
hurting that marketing channel

124
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:26,790
for us, right?

125
00:07:27,089 --> 00:07:30,750
Alban: Yeah, I guess what I was
saying is, we were not being

126
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:34,920
hypocritical in the way that we
created the video, the content,

127
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:38,250
because we weren't publishing
the static image with the audio.

128
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:41,970
But the reason we say we
recommend everybody else not to

129
00:07:41,970 --> 00:07:45,660
do that, is because what it's
doing is it's showing YouTube

130
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:48,480
that your content is low
quality, and it's a specific

131
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:53,670
type of content. It's audio plus
an image. Well, when we were

132
00:07:53,670 --> 00:07:57,389
looking at it, YouTube was used
to a much higher production

133
00:07:57,389 --> 00:08:02,639
quality, a very different type
of content for our channel. And

134
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:05,790
so I think people were
constantly confused. They're

135
00:08:05,790 --> 00:08:10,709
running into videos that they
thought were going to be Travis

136
00:08:10,709 --> 00:08:14,490
or Sarah jalon, doing an in
depth tutorial. And they were

137
00:08:14,490 --> 00:08:18,360
clicking, and they were finding
me pontificating about Facebook

138
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:22,199
podcasts for 20 minutes. So
Travis, give us some more

139
00:08:22,199 --> 00:08:26,009
insight, what's what are the
differentiators between our day

140
00:08:26,009 --> 00:08:29,639
to day content are the bread and
butter that we do very well, and

141
00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:31,350
what Buzzcast was doing on our
channel?

142
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:34,379
Travis: One thing to keep in
mind is when we create content

143
00:08:34,379 --> 00:08:38,490
for Podcasting, Q&A, when we
create tutorials, things like

144
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:42,090
that, we have a very specific
aim for those videos. Right? So

145
00:08:42,090 --> 00:08:45,210
we're trying to answer questions
really well, we're trying to

146
00:08:45,419 --> 00:08:49,440
take all the knowledge and best
practices for how to be a

147
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:54,269
podcaster. And consolidating
that into a form factor. That is

148
00:08:54,299 --> 00:08:56,519
something you could easily watch
in just a few minutes and get

149
00:08:56,549 --> 00:09:00,690
all the information that you
need. And because we're able to

150
00:09:00,809 --> 00:09:03,600
put that level of focus on it,
like Alan mentioned, the

151
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,960
production quality is better. We
have custom animations, and B

152
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:09,419
roll, which is just a fancy way
of saying we cut away to

153
00:09:09,419 --> 00:09:12,720
different videos of models doing
things that match what we're

154
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:18,960
talking about on screen. And so
we're able to create a type of

155
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:23,730
content that works really well
in a YouTube ecosystem. And so

156
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:26,909
if your whole channel is that
kind of content, then YouTube

157
00:09:26,909 --> 00:09:31,379
starts knowing Okay, if someone
we've kind of identified them as

158
00:09:31,379 --> 00:09:33,870
a potential podcaster, and
they're asking a podcast related

159
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:36,690
question, Buzzsprout is going to
be the channel we recommend

160
00:09:36,690 --> 00:09:39,960
because we know they have this
kind of content. The reason that

161
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:44,220
we split off Buzzcast the full
episodes into a separate channel

162
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:49,590
a couple of months ago, is
because we noticed that those

163
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:54,210
videos were not performing at
all at the same level as the

164
00:09:54,539 --> 00:09:57,750
Podcasting, Q&A and other
tutorial videos were doing. And

165
00:09:57,750 --> 00:10:00,509
that was a common practice we'd
seen with other youtubers That

166
00:10:00,509 --> 00:10:03,690
created video podcasts, they
would create new channels for

167
00:10:03,690 --> 00:10:06,029
them. And then if they had
clips, that would be a third

168
00:10:06,029 --> 00:10:07,679
channel. So they would actually
have three channels, they'd have

169
00:10:07,679 --> 00:10:10,440
their main YouTube channel, a
full podcast channel and a clips

170
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:14,129
channel, in order to make sure
that they were kind of playing

171
00:10:14,129 --> 00:10:16,679
by the rules, the best practice
of YouTube. So these were all

172
00:10:16,679 --> 00:10:19,889
things that we, you know, as we
were experimenting, we weren't

173
00:10:19,889 --> 00:10:23,009
sure like, how far are we really
going to carry this book? Like,

174
00:10:23,009 --> 00:10:27,690
how invested Are we going to get
into video Buzzcast. And so it

175
00:10:27,690 --> 00:10:30,149
didn't make sense to spin up a
whole YouTube channel, we're

176
00:10:30,149 --> 00:10:32,549
just going to do a couple
episodes and then retire it

177
00:10:32,549 --> 00:10:35,970
right. So we tested in our on
our main channel first and said,

178
00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:39,179
Okay, that's working. So then
what if we took the next step,

179
00:10:39,179 --> 00:10:41,669
and we made it consistent? And
then what if we took the next

180
00:10:41,669 --> 00:10:44,100
step and made a separate, and so
it's kind of like evolved over

181
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:48,720
time. And now to Kevin's point,
it's at the place where we just

182
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:52,440
wanted to make sure, if we keep
going on this trajectory, it's

183
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:55,919
going to serve you guys, it's
gonna make Buzzcast better for

184
00:10:55,919 --> 00:10:59,279
you. And it's also going to make
sense in the grand scheme of the

185
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:02,940
other things that we're doing to
produce and create content. And

186
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:06,480
so we're now at this nexus point
where if we're going to be able

187
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:10,289
to go back and record in the
studio, you know, that has a

188
00:11:10,289 --> 00:11:12,750
level of production that even
exceeds what we're currently

189
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:17,370
what we were doing before. And,
and so at this point in time, it

190
00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:21,029
makes more sense for us to pause
it, knowing we can always turn

191
00:11:21,029 --> 00:11:24,269
it back on later. But just to
double down and refocus our

192
00:11:24,269 --> 00:11:26,940
efforts on the audio only
version of Buzzcast.

193
00:11:27,299 --> 00:11:30,629
Alban: So if I can kind of tie
this together with what are the

194
00:11:30,629 --> 00:11:35,429
best practices we have learned
for YouTube, and podcasting, in

195
00:11:35,429 --> 00:11:40,470
particular, because podcasting
is really growing on YouTube,

196
00:11:41,129 --> 00:11:44,850
one out of five people now who
say they listened to podcasts,

197
00:11:44,850 --> 00:11:48,419
they listened to most of their
podcasts on YouTube, one out of

198
00:11:48,419 --> 00:11:53,639
five, that's pretty remarkably
high numbers. That comes from

199
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:57,659
Edison research. I actually
interviewed Tom Webster this

200
00:11:57,659 --> 00:12:01,289
morning, and he told me that so
it's definitely working there.

201
00:12:01,769 --> 00:12:06,059
But it takes a lot to make it
work. And it was not stuff that

202
00:12:06,059 --> 00:12:10,019
was going to make sense for us
to do. So. I think to do

203
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:14,129
podcasts, well on YouTube, you
probably need to be recording a

204
00:12:14,129 --> 00:12:19,620
person so that you have that
live engaging element. Because I

205
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:23,490
don't know how to say this
exactly. But like, the level of

206
00:12:23,490 --> 00:12:28,620
engagement you want to see
between the hosts during a audio

207
00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:33,029
and a video medium is very
different. Right now, like I can

208
00:12:33,029 --> 00:12:36,240
see Kevin and Travis and like
Kevin looks kind of

209
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:39,330
disinterested. That doesn't
bother anybody who's just

210
00:12:39,330 --> 00:12:41,340
listening to this because they
go, Oh, Kevin's probably

211
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:48,059
listening attentively. But you
know what? But if we're on

212
00:12:48,059 --> 00:12:51,059
video, I'd be the first comment
we ever got on one of our

213
00:12:51,059 --> 00:12:54,570
Buzzcast episodes was why does
albot look so mad. And I was

214
00:12:54,570 --> 00:12:59,190
like, Oh, that's just my face
looks. That's just me. Like,

215
00:12:59,190 --> 00:13:03,629
that's just me not smiling. And
so that works perfectly fine.

216
00:13:03,659 --> 00:13:07,230
When you're recording long
distance recordings. When it's

217
00:13:07,230 --> 00:13:11,549
on video, it starts to look a
little weird. And you can either

218
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:15,509
kind of over fake enthusiasm, or
you can get together in an audio

219
00:13:15,509 --> 00:13:19,379
studio get together in a studio
in person. So like, get together

220
00:13:19,379 --> 00:13:23,370
in person, I think is a very
high recommendation, they should

221
00:13:23,370 --> 00:13:28,200
try to get that number, you
know, if at all possible, then

222
00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:31,379
you've also got to have like
multiple shots to be able to

223
00:13:31,379 --> 00:13:34,470
keep it interesting. So that's
probably a camera on each host.

224
00:13:35,009 --> 00:13:38,700
Maybe an additional wide angle
camera, you can see that we've

225
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:42,090
experimented this in some of our
Podcasting Q&A videos is

226
00:13:42,090 --> 00:13:45,929
rolling, I think three different
cameras now all at once, and

227
00:13:45,929 --> 00:13:50,700
then we flipped between them.
For us to do the three of us in

228
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:55,110
the studio would require us
probably to be shooting like

229
00:13:55,110 --> 00:13:59,909
four or five cameras at a time.
And then the, you know, that

230
00:13:59,909 --> 00:14:03,330
really ramps up the amount of
video editing that we're doing.

231
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:06,509
Okay, so we're buying a bunch of
cameras. We're buying, we're

232
00:14:06,509 --> 00:14:09,960
doing more in video editing.
We're getting us all together in

233
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:13,259
the studio in the most
dangerous, dangerous COVID

234
00:14:13,259 --> 00:14:17,789
hotspot United States right now.
So three negatives, and all for

235
00:14:17,789 --> 00:14:21,090
the benefit of starting a new
YouTube channel that isn't

236
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:24,929
exactly in alignment with what
we want. So that's to kind of

237
00:14:24,929 --> 00:14:28,289
wrap it up quickly. What how
we're thinking about this. Maybe

238
00:14:28,289 --> 00:14:32,340
we come back, maybe not. But
until next time, listen to us on

239
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:34,710
our RSS backed podcast.

240
00:14:35,099 --> 00:14:38,668
Travis: Yes, we are definitely
not going anywhere. You'll just

241
00:14:38,668 --> 00:14:41,399
need to listen to us anywhere
except for Spotify will be.

242
00:14:42,419 --> 00:14:45,269
Alban: This is basically Apple
podcasts and indie apps

243
00:14:45,269 --> 00:14:48,269
exclusive now. Yeah, I would say
so. I would say so.

244
00:14:48,568 --> 00:14:50,849
Kevin: Yeah. I think it's an
interesting point that you

245
00:14:50,849 --> 00:14:53,339
talked about when you talk about
your interview with Tom Webster

246
00:14:53,339 --> 00:14:56,219
and he's saying that one in five
podcasts are roughly 20% of

247
00:14:56,249 --> 00:14:59,969
people listening the podcast in
YouTube, and I can't help it

248
00:14:59,999 --> 00:15:05,399
think that that is it just don't
think that there's a stat that

249
00:15:05,399 --> 00:15:10,259
we should just take without some
additional thought, right? Like

250
00:15:10,619 --> 00:15:12,538
listening to a podcast and
YouTube is a different

251
00:15:12,538 --> 00:15:15,989
experience than what a lot of us
who produce podcasts are in the

252
00:15:15,989 --> 00:15:18,089
podcasting space probably think
about when we think about

253
00:15:18,119 --> 00:15:21,328
podcasting, like the benefits in
the beauty of podcasting is it's

254
00:15:21,328 --> 00:15:23,908
it's passive, it's something
that you can do not only on

255
00:15:23,908 --> 00:15:26,068
demand, but at your convenience
while you're doing other things

256
00:15:26,068 --> 00:15:27,899
while you're doing housework
while you're exercising, while

257
00:15:27,899 --> 00:15:30,328
you're at work while you're
driving a car, you the YouTube

258
00:15:30,328 --> 00:15:34,229
experience is different than
that. And so while the YouTube

259
00:15:34,229 --> 00:15:37,198
ecosystem is huge, and it might
be a lot more mainstream in

260
00:15:37,198 --> 00:15:39,239
terms of the number of people
who engage in that space, and

261
00:15:39,239 --> 00:15:41,818
then at some point, click on
something that is calling itself

262
00:15:41,818 --> 00:15:45,928
a podcast, it's, it might just
be an exposure thing, it might

263
00:15:45,928 --> 00:15:47,849
just be the size of the
ecosystem thing, it might not

264
00:15:47,849 --> 00:15:52,048
necessarily be what we would
consider a podcast and all the

265
00:15:52,048 --> 00:15:53,938
great benefits that go along
with podcasting. And I don't

266
00:15:53,938 --> 00:15:56,788
want to get into the details of
is it does it really have an RSS

267
00:15:56,788 --> 00:15:58,438
feed and all that stuff, that's
not really what I'm talking

268
00:15:58,438 --> 00:16:00,658
about. I'm just kind of talking
about the size of the medium and

269
00:16:00,658 --> 00:16:02,999
the number of people who at some
point during their normal day,

270
00:16:03,208 --> 00:16:05,788
flip open YouTube, and might
click on something that is

271
00:16:05,788 --> 00:16:11,129
calling itself a podcast. So
that being said, YouTube is a

272
00:16:11,158 --> 00:16:13,769
fine place for you to distribute
content and being creator. But

273
00:16:13,769 --> 00:16:16,288
hopefully, there's some
takeaways from what we've

274
00:16:16,288 --> 00:16:18,719
experienced over the past year,
pressing into the YouTube Space

275
00:16:18,719 --> 00:16:22,438
a little bit in terms of putting
a podcast onto YouTube, there's

276
00:16:22,438 --> 00:16:25,828
a lot more that goes into it
than just recording a zoom call,

277
00:16:25,948 --> 00:16:28,109
and then throwing it up there.
If you really want to succeed,

278
00:16:28,469 --> 00:16:30,058
you have to understand the
algorithm, you have to

279
00:16:30,058 --> 00:16:32,188
understand how the medium works,
you have to understand what type

280
00:16:32,188 --> 00:16:35,249
of content works there is, this
is a larger level of commitment.

281
00:16:35,399 --> 00:16:38,188
And you might find a huge
audience and huge following

282
00:16:38,188 --> 00:16:43,259
there. But it's probably not
going to be it's not an

283
00:16:43,259 --> 00:16:45,269
overnight success. It is a lot
of work. And it is very

284
00:16:45,269 --> 00:16:47,849
different than audio only
podcasting. So as we continue to

285
00:16:47,849 --> 00:16:52,558
unpack, and learn things about
how to use YouTube, or other

286
00:16:52,558 --> 00:16:55,649
channels to grow your main
podcast, your audio only

287
00:16:55,649 --> 00:16:58,379
podcast, it's distributed
through RSS, we will continue to

288
00:16:58,379 --> 00:17:00,178
share those learnings with you
and hopefully make you a better

289
00:17:00,178 --> 00:17:03,719
podcaster. But this is where we
are today. And the decisions

290
00:17:03,719 --> 00:17:07,648
we've made. So this podcast will
not be on YouTube, and not in

291
00:17:07,648 --> 00:17:11,638
video form. And as we learn more
and grow more, we'll share all

292
00:17:11,638 --> 00:17:12,179
our learnings with

293
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:17,609
Travis: so if you've been a
Buzzcast listener for any length

294
00:17:17,609 --> 00:17:21,900
of time, you know, we're big
fans of the podcast index and

295
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:25,079
podcasting 2.0, that entire
group, that entire working group

296
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:29,279
of people dedicating themselves
to improving the open podcast

297
00:17:29,279 --> 00:17:33,000
ecosystem, and creating really
fun new features that allow you

298
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,420
as a creator, to make awesome
content and help your listeners

299
00:17:36,690 --> 00:17:40,349
really engage with your show in
some really unique ways. Kevin

300
00:17:40,349 --> 00:17:44,069
and Tom had an opportunity to
sit down with Dave Jones, who is

301
00:17:44,069 --> 00:17:47,309
working on the podcast index and
podcasting 2.0 to talk about a

302
00:17:47,309 --> 00:17:52,170
new feature that Buzzsprout is
now supporting, and also tease

303
00:17:52,170 --> 00:17:54,839
out some fun new things that
they have coming down the

304
00:17:54,839 --> 00:17:57,960
pipeline. So here's that
conversation between Kevin Tom

305
00:17:58,170 --> 00:17:59,009
and Dave Jones.

306
00:17:59,309 --> 00:18:01,589
Tom: This is Tom Rossi,
technical co founder of

307
00:18:01,589 --> 00:18:06,990
Buzzsprout. And I am glad to be
joined by Dave Jones, one of the

308
00:18:06,990 --> 00:18:10,109
two guys running the podcast
index, Dave Jones and Adam curry

309
00:18:10,109 --> 00:18:13,859
have been doing amazing work
with the podcast index. Dave,

310
00:18:13,890 --> 00:18:17,910
welcome to the show. Thanks for
all that you're doing. Tell us a

311
00:18:17,910 --> 00:18:20,640
little bit about the podcast
index and what you guys are

312
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:21,269
doing over there.

313
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:23,640
Dave: Let's see, what are we
doing at the podcast? And what

314
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:24,839
are we not doing at podcast?

315
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:29,819
Kevin: So Dave, the podcasting
to auto project is like it

316
00:18:29,819 --> 00:18:32,700
incorporates the podcast index
and the podcasting namespace

317
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:34,650
right and a whole bunch of
things. Can you tell us like

318
00:18:34,650 --> 00:18:36,690
what's the difference? What are
the two functions that those

319
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,880
those two things sort of where
they come together? How does it

320
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:39,299
all work?

321
00:18:39,450 --> 00:18:42,480
Dave: Yeah, we get this question
a lot. What the heck are y'all

322
00:18:42,539 --> 00:18:45,630
doing with all these various
projects? And then what did they

323
00:18:45,630 --> 00:18:51,509
even mean? And so podcasting 2.0
is the name of our podcast, but

324
00:18:51,509 --> 00:18:54,359
it's also the name of the
broader movement of trying to

325
00:18:54,359 --> 00:18:57,269
preserve, protect and extend the
open RSS ecosystem,

326
00:18:57,299 --> 00:18:59,009
Kevin: right. When we say this,
this is a little bit different

327
00:18:59,009 --> 00:19:01,680
than what like fireside chat
introduced it podcast movement,

328
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:04,109
is podcasting to Dotto, right.
Yeah,

329
00:19:04,259 --> 00:19:07,680
Dave: I gotta hope it is
completely different. Yeah, but

330
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:13,289
podcasting. 2.0 is just an open
source, volunteer movement of

331
00:19:13,289 --> 00:19:17,130
people coming up with ideas and
launching projects to help

332
00:19:17,369 --> 00:19:21,750
preserve the open RSS ecosystem
of podcasting, and podcasting

333
00:19:21,779 --> 00:19:24,539
inside the app. So pod inside
podcasting 2.0. But that would

334
00:19:24,539 --> 00:19:26,970
be the podcast namespace where
all these new features and tags

335
00:19:26,970 --> 00:19:30,029
are coming from. Also within
podcasting, 2.0 would be

336
00:19:30,029 --> 00:19:33,720
something like pod ping, which
allows hosts to rapidly notified

337
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:36,930
apps and aggregators of new
episodes, things like that.

338
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:40,230
That's all in the podcasting 2.0
side of things. The podcast

339
00:19:40,259 --> 00:19:44,849
index is the thing that we
created at the very beginning in

340
00:19:44,849 --> 00:19:48,150
order to facilitate all these
other things. So the podcast

341
00:19:48,150 --> 00:19:51,390
index is the largest directory
of podcasts on the internet.

342
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:55,829
It's were like 4.1 million
podcasts right now feeds. We are

343
00:19:55,829 --> 00:20:01,710
a directory and also an API for
podcast app. to hook in to get

344
00:20:01,710 --> 00:20:04,289
their podcast data from,
basically, they just start

345
00:20:04,289 --> 00:20:08,220
coding an app, they plug into us
and they get all their data in,

346
00:20:08,339 --> 00:20:12,210
it saves them a world of hurt on
that side of things. So those,

347
00:20:12,450 --> 00:20:16,470
the podcasts index is the APN
directory, but geisen 2.0 is all

348
00:20:16,470 --> 00:20:18,599
the features and community
movement.

349
00:20:19,230 --> 00:20:22,349
Kevin: Right, and then huge
opportunity with the index is

350
00:20:22,349 --> 00:20:24,930
that we're not tied in or
reliant on Apple anymore. So

351
00:20:24,930 --> 00:20:26,910
like over the past two or three
months, Apple's directory has

352
00:20:26,910 --> 00:20:29,609
been having a ton of problems.
Not to mention even before that,

353
00:20:29,609 --> 00:20:31,769
when it was working, well, it
would take you probably a

354
00:20:31,769 --> 00:20:34,769
minimum of two or three days up
to a couple weeks to even get in

355
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:37,710
Apple podcast directory, then
when you publish a new episode,

356
00:20:37,710 --> 00:20:40,950
it might be 24 hours or more
before that new episode gets

357
00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:43,740
released in search showing up on
any of the apps that rely on

358
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:46,950
that directory. And the index
solves all that along with other

359
00:20:46,950 --> 00:20:49,440
technologies that you're
developing as well like the pod

360
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:50,460
paying and everything else.
Right.

361
00:20:50,519 --> 00:20:53,519
Dave: Yeah, we started this
whole project with with the

362
00:20:53,519 --> 00:20:56,700
directory and the API with the
idea that we wanted to take

363
00:20:57,210 --> 00:21:02,250
Apple Apple's directory away
from being the center of the

364
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:05,430
podcasting universe, which has
been for, you know, 15 years at

365
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:10,710
least. And the idea there was
that, you know, no, no knock on

366
00:21:10,710 --> 00:21:13,319
Apple, I mean, they've been good
stewards of podcasting, it's

367
00:21:13,319 --> 00:21:17,819
just that it doesn't make a lot
of sense for an open

368
00:21:18,599 --> 00:21:23,549
specification, like podcasting,
an open system that anybody can

369
00:21:23,549 --> 00:21:29,069
participate in, it does not make
a lot of sense for that. To be

370
00:21:29,069 --> 00:21:33,180
controlled by a single humongous
entity like apple, I mean,

371
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:35,670
they're literally the biggest
company in the world. And so

372
00:21:35,670 --> 00:21:37,890
it's sort of like you have this
weird spectrum where you got

373
00:21:37,890 --> 00:21:41,819
podcasting, which is completely
open, I can hand write an RSS

374
00:21:41,819 --> 00:21:45,150
feed today, and get into the
inbox and create a podcast. And

375
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:48,779
I can do it from my computer in
five minutes. But then you have

376
00:21:49,049 --> 00:21:52,559
the directory where all the
podcasts are found, his career

377
00:21:52,589 --> 00:21:56,220
is controlled by this huge
corporation. So it really just

378
00:21:56,220 --> 00:22:00,059
didn't didn't make a lot of
sense, the goal there was create

379
00:22:00,059 --> 00:22:03,930
a directory that is completely
open, anybody can join it,

380
00:22:03,930 --> 00:22:07,230
anybody can add to it, anybody
can put their podcast into it in

381
00:22:07,410 --> 00:22:12,059
15 seconds. And then the next
step, which is the which is the

382
00:22:12,059 --> 00:22:15,509
part that has to happen, make it
available for free, and

383
00:22:15,509 --> 00:22:18,690
everybody can download it, you
can download it our entire

384
00:22:18,690 --> 00:22:23,220
database right now from our From
the homepage of our website, and

385
00:22:23,369 --> 00:22:25,470
do whatever you want with it,
you can go create your own

386
00:22:25,470 --> 00:22:28,710
directory or your own API or
your own apps. So if it's not

387
00:22:28,710 --> 00:22:32,069
free, then it doesn't solve any
of the problem. And if you have

388
00:22:32,069 --> 00:22:34,349
to have us, it still doesn't
solve the problem. You need to

389
00:22:34,349 --> 00:22:37,109
be we need to redistribute it.
And so that's what we that was

390
00:22:37,109 --> 00:22:38,039
the Gulf in the beginning.

391
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:40,890
Tom: One of the features that
I'm most excited about out of

392
00:22:40,890 --> 00:22:44,190
podcasting 2.0 is pod ping, can
you tell us a little bit about

393
00:22:44,190 --> 00:22:44,460
that?

394
00:22:44,519 --> 00:22:47,430
Dave: Yeah, sure. podcasting
suffers from the same thing that

395
00:22:47,430 --> 00:22:52,769
all RSS based infrastructure
does it, what you have is a

396
00:22:52,769 --> 00:22:55,890
system where you publish an
episode of whatever this is, or

397
00:22:55,890 --> 00:23:00,329
a blog post or anything, any bit
of information, you publish that

398
00:23:00,329 --> 00:23:04,289
to an RSS feed, think of it like
a WordPress blog. So then the

399
00:23:04,289 --> 00:23:07,349
RSS feed, which is just a file
on a web server somewhere, it

400
00:23:07,349 --> 00:23:10,440
gets updated. How does the rest
of the world know that you've

401
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:13,650
just put a blog post up on your
website, they have to be

402
00:23:13,650 --> 00:23:17,579
notified, or they have to go and
check in there's, there's the

403
00:23:17,579 --> 00:23:20,940
only two ways to get that
information. So just think of it

404
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:24,329
like, you know, clicking on a
website refresh button over and

405
00:23:24,329 --> 00:23:27,779
over and over just to see if
something new pops up. That's

406
00:23:27,779 --> 00:23:31,440
essentially what all of these
infrastructures have to do,

407
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:34,019
whether it's podcasting or
blogosphere, or any of these

408
00:23:34,019 --> 00:23:37,079
things. It's just what you
resort to is just checking the

409
00:23:37,079 --> 00:23:38,279
website over and over and over.

410
00:23:38,549 --> 00:23:40,619
Tom: And this is this is one of
the things that we see all the

411
00:23:40,619 --> 00:23:43,259
time, right, where we have
podcasters, who will publish an

412
00:23:43,259 --> 00:23:46,950
episode. And then they're
wondering, Well, where is it? I

413
00:23:46,950 --> 00:23:49,710
published it an hour ago? Why
don't I see it anywhere? Why

414
00:23:49,710 --> 00:23:52,440
don't I see it on Apple? Why
don't I see it on Spotify? And I

415
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:56,190
think what what's exciting about
pod pain is this is a solution

416
00:23:56,190 --> 00:24:00,539
to that problem, which is if you
subscribe to a feed with with

417
00:24:00,539 --> 00:24:03,779
pod pain, you'll know whenever
it gets updated. You'll know

418
00:24:03,779 --> 00:24:04,769
about it immediately.

419
00:24:05,130 --> 00:24:08,849
Dave: Yeah, and that's a just a
reversal of that whole thing of

420
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:11,400
instead of checking over and
over and over for new content.

421
00:24:11,910 --> 00:24:15,119
We tell you, you know, the
publisher tells you when there's

422
00:24:15,119 --> 00:24:15,660
content,

423
00:24:15,930 --> 00:24:18,630
Tom: pod ping solves two
problems. One is the polling

424
00:24:18,869 --> 00:24:22,470
with RSS feeds. And then you
also have the problem of much of

425
00:24:22,470 --> 00:24:27,450
the web sub pub pub is built on
Google, which isn't reliable. So

426
00:24:27,450 --> 00:24:30,089
pod ping does it in a reliable
way. And so as I've talked to

427
00:24:30,089 --> 00:24:32,009
people about pod paying, and
they said, Well, don't we

428
00:24:32,009 --> 00:24:33,930
already have a solution for
this? Well, we don't have a

429
00:24:33,930 --> 00:24:37,259
reliable solution for this. And
so that's why a lot of people

430
00:24:37,259 --> 00:24:40,920
just continue to pull RSS feeds.
So really excited about the work

431
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:44,730
that you did with with pod Ping.
One of the features of the

432
00:24:44,759 --> 00:24:47,490
podcast namespace that we've
just implemented at Buzzsprout.

433
00:24:47,519 --> 00:24:51,390
That I'm sure everyone would
love to hear why we did it. Is

434
00:24:51,390 --> 00:24:56,009
the gu ID, or the gu ID. How do
you say Dave gwit? Yeah, let's

435
00:24:56,009 --> 00:24:59,250
Duguid. Goo it sounds gross.
Let's do good. There's no way

436
00:24:59,250 --> 00:25:02,220
around it that it's He's gonna
sound gross. So but tell us

437
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:06,599
what, what's the grid? And why
do you want podcasting companies

438
00:25:06,599 --> 00:25:09,569
like Buzzsprout and podcasters.
to include this in their RSS

439
00:25:09,569 --> 00:25:09,869
feed,

440
00:25:10,259 --> 00:25:15,329
Dave: a grid is a globally
unique identifier, geo ID. It is

441
00:25:15,359 --> 00:25:20,279
a long number that uniquely
identifies a thing and object

442
00:25:20,730 --> 00:25:25,950
globally in the world. It's this
thing is this number. And so

443
00:25:26,009 --> 00:25:29,970
that is a thing that Apple's
directory has always had.

444
00:25:30,599 --> 00:25:35,069
Everybody's podcast has an
iTunes ID, or an apple podcast

445
00:25:35,099 --> 00:25:40,410
ID. And if you go and look for
your podcast on Apple's podcast

446
00:25:40,410 --> 00:25:42,990
directory, you can see at the
end of the little URL in the

447
00:25:42,990 --> 00:25:46,619
address bar up there, you can
see your Apple ID, because Apple

448
00:25:46,619 --> 00:25:49,170
has been the center of the
podcasting universe for so long,

449
00:25:49,650 --> 00:25:54,420
that iTunes ID has become the
way that many apps identify a

450
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:59,220
podcast in there's problems with
that. We solve those problems

451
00:25:59,250 --> 00:26:04,559
earlier this year, when Apple's
API stopped returning the

452
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:09,000
location of where podcast live
at. So they stopped returning in

453
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:13,200
their API for many, many feeds,
they stopped returning the

454
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:16,890
actual URL, which is would be
like, you know, buzzsprout.com

455
00:26:16,890 --> 00:26:20,190
slash such and such. That's a
huge problem because it broke

456
00:26:20,190 --> 00:26:24,180
tons of apps. And we were on the
front lines of that, because a

457
00:26:24,180 --> 00:26:26,789
lot of people started using our
API when that happened, because

458
00:26:26,789 --> 00:26:28,410
it broke and broke their app.

459
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:31,650
Kevin: Is this stuff going to
help us move in the direction of

460
00:26:31,950 --> 00:26:35,039
like global comments, global
ratings and reviews? Are you

461
00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:38,970
guys working on infrastructure
to be able to allow podcasters

462
00:26:38,970 --> 00:26:42,539
to leave a five star rating in
one app that then translates

463
00:26:42,539 --> 00:26:45,960
over to another app or a comment
over here on pod friend that

464
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:48,390
could get posted in pod chaser?

465
00:26:48,779 --> 00:26:51,539
Dave: Yeah, I hope so. I mean,
that's the idea. That's, that's

466
00:26:51,539 --> 00:26:52,980
absolutely the goal with this.

467
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:56,640
Tom: Just a quick note for our
Buzzsprout listeners, don't you

468
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:59,730
don't have to write into the
port and ask us to put a grid on

469
00:26:59,730 --> 00:27:03,029
your RSS feed, they're already
there. So all these features

470
00:27:03,029 --> 00:27:06,089
whenever we can we want to
implement them without having to

471
00:27:06,089 --> 00:27:09,420
require, you know, any, any kind
of, you know, technical

472
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:12,420
knowledge on our podcasters. And
so, yes, the goods are already

473
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:14,970
there. And we continue to follow
all the work that Dave and Adam

474
00:27:14,970 --> 00:27:17,400
are doing, and we will implement
those features as they come up.
