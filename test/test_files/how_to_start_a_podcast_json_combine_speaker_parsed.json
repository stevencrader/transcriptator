Uh, so I hope the, these episodes have been super helpful for you getting your show off the ground and having the confidence that you need to really launch a podcast, which is such an incredible thing. Now, I recently had the opportunity to sit down for a conversation with Eric Nuzum, who is been an executive producer on some of the biggest podcasts in the world, many of NPRs podcast, Ted's podcasts, um, and just brings a lot of insight and depth of wisdom to podcasting. And so I wanted to share this with you as kind of like a podcasting 201. This interview is what to do once you have your show going and you really want to see what's the next step. What's the next level that I can get to with my podcast. Uh, he just wrote a brand new book on podcasting called Make Noise. I will leave a link to the book in the episode description. It's a fantastic book. So I hope that this conversation is helpful for you and that you get a lot out of it. And without further ado, here's my conversation with Eric Nuzum."

            "body": "So my name is Eric Nuzum and, uh, I, um, spent most of the early part of my career in broadcast and eventually worked my way up to working at NPR. And I started there in 2004 and listening less than a year later, I was in the, um, the cafeteria line at NPR and the guy who was our COO at the time was behind me trying to make some kind of awkward chit-chat. He says, well, what's interesting that you've seen lately. And I said, well, there's this podcasting thing. And I started explaining to him in the lunch line, just gotta make conversation. He's like, Oh, come by and give me a little spiel on it. And so I came, I made an appointment, went and gave a spiel a couple of weeks later, he shows back up at my door and says, you have a team of eight and you have 12 weeks. And at the end of that 12 weeks, we want there to be NPR podcasts. I'm like, okay. And we actually delivered it a month. We got an extra month. Uh, we delivered it. It was 32 podcasts. And then for the following decade, I kind of remained kind of the editorial lead on NPR podcasts, both figuring out how to take in pair programming and have it thrive in the podcast world, sound authentic there and also making new things that were intended originally to be in that space and did that for a decade. And then a couple of years ago, probably four and a half years or so ago, I left NPR and went to Ottawa, which is part of the Amazon. Uh, you, you extended universe and, um, uh, created original the original content team there. Uh, and then about a year or so ago, uh, one of my friends and I left and started magnificent noise, which is a, uh, um, which is a podcast production and consultation company, uh, based in New York.

And, and specifically one of the things that you harp on, uh, which we'll dive into about the 10 word description, I was like, let me go back to the front cover and see if he followed his own rules. He did even got an extra word, despair, a creative guide to podcasting and great audio storytelling. Um, so why did you feel like now was the time to publish this book that you've been in podcasting basically since the beginning longer than just about anyone listening to this episode? Uh, so why did you feel like now is a really good time to, to bring this book out into the world and step into, uh, promote it?"

            "body": "That's a really good question because I think there's two factors. One, I think we are now at the point where there's such a groundswell of interest in podcasting that, that having a book about podcast creation, that isn't like tips for equipment to buy or how to make money at it, but it's really focused on how to do something. Well, that's a commercially viable product now. And I don't think even a couple of years ago, it was when I had been approached a couple of times about doing this over the years. And I'm like, I just don't think it's, I think it's a niche product. I don't think it's going to be worth my time to spend time writing that book. And, um, the last time I was asked about it, I said, yes, and was kind of shocked at the reaction. And you know, one of the great things about seeing podcasting evolve is watching at points like this, um, that this is, you know, a profession and a vocation and a hobby, and there are tools for it with a book or microphones or recording units or things that were literally unimaginable four or five years ago. Now I'm a, I'm a big fan of the Roadcaster pro, which is a little desktop unit though. I advocate a lot of podcasters buy because it's$600 containing technology that will cost you 10,$15,000 to duplicate four or five years ago. I mean, that to me is exciting and amazing. So first I think we've kind of matured into being an industry now that can support that kind of thinking and a product like, like a book. And the second reason is, um, there's so many new podcasts and, and the thing that surprises me is someone who is a consultant for a lot of people, individuals and I, I work with people who are sitting around their kitchen table, trying to figure things out up to some of the largest media companies in the world and the conversations they have are almost identical, even though you have many more dollars, much bigger names and, um, uh, you know, uh, resources and crazy resources compared to people who are trying to figure out how to do this with their friend, their obstacles are often the same they're kind of concerns or, or, or, or fears of how to get into this. And they get stuck on the same things too. And so when I started to realize how universal a lot of the problems are that prevent people from being able to achieve what they want to do. Um, I like there's, there's solutions to that. I've struggled through this a lot myself. So I just, and I was also worried when, when I was first asked about this book that I could write about a chapter and about that would be about it. And so I had a couple of days off, for some reason, I sat down and said, okay, I'm just going to try. I didn't even say yes to write in the book. I'm just going to try to write a chapter. And I sat down on a thought about what frustrates people and I just started. And it became very clear to me that there was something to be said to an increasingly growing community of people."

            "body": "Well, and what I appreciate about the angle that you took with the book is that it's not, it isn't, it, isn't a book for beginner podcasters in the sense that if you're just getting started, it's a very valuable resource to help you avoid some of those early mistakes, classic mistakes, rookie mistakes that you see, but it's also extremely challenging. Even for someone like myself, that's been in podcasting for years to like you start reading through this. And you're like, I don't do half the stuff that I even intellectually know I should be doing. Um, and one, one that I, I want to really spend some time with, cause I feel like it would be the most valuable for people listening is the 10 word description, because one of my constant wrestling matches is that I, as a, as a creative outlet, want my podcast to be self-serving in certain ways, right? Like I want to wake up excited about making new episodes. I want to, I want to expand my creativity. I want to try new things, experiment with new things. Um, but you do a really good job of kind of helping push against that and in a really good way, and the importance of staying focused and, and really being laser focused on why does your podcast exist for the expectations of your listeners, um, and making sure you over deliver on that. So I'd love to just, maybe even if you want to just share the anecdote that you had about your yoga teacher and kind of going through that exercise. So I thought that was a good story. And I think we'll flesh out the importance of having a really clear idea of what your podcast is about."

            "body": "Yeah. I think a lot of my work is just in general, a lot of my work, including this book is simply taking people's heads and pointing them in a slightly different direction. Uh, they're worried about what they're going to do whenever someone says they want to do a podcast. And I say, what is it? They often describe it from very features based perspective. Oh, I'm going to, I'm going to have conversations with women filmmakers about women in film, right? That's a feature, that's not a benefit. Right. And I always try to get people in that perspective shift is, and this is where my history is. A broadcaster comes in and let's think about the audience for that. Okay. Let's not think about what you are right at this moment. Let's think let's start with the listener. And so, you know, I, I, um, you know, everyone, it used to be part of my kind of standard stump speech. I would say, even the yoga instructor down the street has a podcast. And one day I was in yoga class and my yoga instructor came up to me say, can I talk to you after class? My first thought was like, Oh, what did I do that required a talking to after class? I'm like, Oh, I didn't want to think about this. And I kind of forgot about it. And then he kind of came, he came up to me like either that day or a day later, a next class and said, Hey, you know, I I've, everybody tells me I should have a podcast. And I'm like, Oh, now even my yoga instructor is, has a vodcast or wants to have a podcast. And so I sat down with him and I started talking about some of the concepts that I use with broadcasters or media people and realized they were far too advanced for where he was at. He just had this passion to talk to people and he had something to say, but he had no idea of how to think about it. And so I ended up drawing on a piece of paper, a circle, or what became a circle with a couple of points on it. And it kind of developed an exercise that I still use with people all the time, whether I'm doing it in a bar napkin or on a dry erase board in a conference room where we talk about who is the audience for this, get incredibly specific about who they are and what journey are you putting them on? You know? Uh, and that's why it becomes a circle because all these things filled into a kind of flow into each other of asking yourself, what do you have to say to that person? Once you define them and you get very specific, I make people look up pictures and print them out. We put them up on the wall, we give them names and fake bios. And then we consolidate them all into like what we think the person is. And we know, what do you have to say to them? Who are you, what version of yourself, or what is your voice in this? What is your perspective, your personality, and then what is the outcome, the desired outcome. and then we get into this Exercise that I kind of force people into. And the way I usually do it now, since I, I always evolving this exercise is I make people write it. And then they, then they kind of hide it from everyone. And during the rest of the workshop, they can edit it. And at the end of the workshop, everyone reads their versions of these 10 word descriptions that describe your project and nothing else in the world, no one in the room should be able to say, yeah, there's also another, uh, podcast, a women talking to women filmmakers about women's film. You know, there's, there are others. So what makes yours distinct? Are you focusing on, uh, filmmakers in the Minneapolis st. Paul area? Are you talking about a specific age or a specific genre film, or a specific time period in which films were made, um, that include that in your description? So you're literally describing one podcast in a world of almost a million others, right. And that provides you with an editorial lens that you can then use to make all kinds of decisions about what's right for your podcast, from its title, how it describes itself, its artwork, the type of guests, you have, the kind of conversations you have the answer to those five questions, the basic things that go around the circle and the 10 word as you have that you have a huge amount of clarity that you never would've had before, or spent years kind of figuring out one episode at a time. And many people don't have years to figure it out."
