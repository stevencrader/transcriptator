00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:36,060
country and Alabama. The man who

10
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:38,460

00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:43,260
Unknown: Adam Clark curry. Yes.

13
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:47,970
Dave Jones: Don't for one day.
Party.

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,460
Adam Curry: Why are you being
stern with me? You threw out an

15
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:53,070
Adam Clark curry that triggered
me right away.

16
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:54,660
Dave Jones: Yeah, no, I knew it
would.

17
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:57,390
Adam Curry: David Ashley Jones.

18
00:00:57,510 --> 00:01:03,150
Dave Jones: Yes. There's only
one I only have one rule and

19
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:04,770
then no part no part long gone.

20
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:09,030
Adam Curry: But we cleaned up.
There was only Dame DeLoreans

21
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:11,700
panties apparently around the
flagpole. Everything else was

22
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:15,060
clean. We didn't do anything.
Anything bad. I'm so sorry.

23
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,540
Dave Jones: It was much
entertaining.

24
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:20,910
Adam Curry: Oh, well. You heard
it while you're at the office

25
00:01:20,910 --> 00:01:21,330
listening.

26
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:24,630
Dave Jones: I got a bootleg. I
got somebody sent me a bootleg.

27
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:25,290
Okay, I

28
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:28,020
Adam Curry: purposely did not
record because I didn't want any

29
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:30,660
evidence that we were breaking
the law not only breaking the

30
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:34,020
law by playing two and a half
hours of licensed music on the

31
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:38,010
stream, but also taking money
for it which which is, I think a

32
00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:39,300
super violation.

33
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:44,040
Dave Jones: There there is there
is a bootleg if you know the

34
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:48,060
right guy down on Fifth Avenue,
behind the corner.

35
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:50,400
Adam Curry: Canal Street is what
you're talking about Canal

36
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:50,700
Street.

37
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:53,850
Dave Jones: With enough sets you
can get a you can get a bootleg

38
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:54,210
for those

39
00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:55,680
Adam Curry: who are wondering
what we're talking about.

40
00:01:55,770 --> 00:01:58,740
Yesterday, we were ready to go
for our regular regularly

41
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:02,250
scheduled board meeting time.
And well there were two things

42
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:05,580
that happen actually, I now the
hill country here in Texas had

43
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:10,620
had a pretty big storm. I have
Thursday, Friday and Thursday

44
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:13,620
and Thursday morning was really
bad with golf ball sized hail,

45
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:19,020
which sounded great against our
metal roof. In the morning, I

46
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:22,470
was crazy. I was I mean the dog
was freaked out. I have not seen

47
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:25,380
our dog freaked out by anything.
But this freaked her out. And

48
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:32,700
then Friday it just I mean, it
really missed Fredericksburg and

49
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:36,450
went right past us. Some prayer
was involved, I'm sure. But

50
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:40,080
Dave Jones: yes, diversionary
prayer. Yes, I forgot.

51
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:44,130
Adam Curry: Yes, but I forgot to
add a diversionary tactic for

52
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:49,020
you. And it hit pretty hard. So
So now, somewhere down the line,

53
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:52,020
my bandwidth was totally
crapping out my upstream was

54
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:57,030
about 500 kilobits per second,
which is not the typical

55
00:02:57,030 --> 00:03:01,080
upstream. And that just as as I
was figuring that out, you know,

56
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:06,420
bringing out different access
points. I've gotten, you know,

57
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:10,800
I've got T Mobile Verizon, I
have, if all else fails, I've

58
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:14,100
got Starlink, although that does
introduce some latency. So we're

59
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:16,800
messing around with that. And
then Dave goes, Oh, bad signal.

60
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:19,590
The power went down in the
office. What happened there?

61
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:24,450
Dave Jones: Yeah, yeah, that's
so yeah, I guess yesterday was a

62
00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:28,980
total cluster. I mean, like, I
got in the car, even going back

63
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:33,540
before what? What happened with
the show, I got in the car, to

64
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:37,320
leave to go to the office for
work. And I get a ping on my

65
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:41,400
phone. I look down at the phone
and it says, you've got a guest,

66
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:47,010
Mike, Michael and Sam from wave
lake at 9am. Oh, right. What?

67
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:52,830
None, right? No. 30. And so I
get to the office and I emailed

68
00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:53,490
them. And I'm like,

69
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:55,050
Adam Curry: and they're always
there. We're sitting ready. They

70
00:03:55,050 --> 00:03:56,580
got the headphones on everything
good.

71
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:01,770
Dave Jones: I was like, Hey,
guys, please tell me this was a

72
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,650
this was a timezone mix up. And
I didn't actually send you a

73
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:06,570
load report. And they were like,
No, you send it for nine. I was

74
00:04:06,570 --> 00:04:07,500
like, damn it.

75
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:10,080
Adam Curry: How does it? How
does that happen? Because you

76
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:13,470
use you know, use Google use
your calendar for that.

77
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:16,920
Dave Jones: Now use fast mails,
calendar, but it's all through

78
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:21,420
the iPhone. I don't think I've
ever messed that up in in a

79
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:25,590
mess. I just totally boned it. I
mean, like, it was terrible. And

80
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:28,890
then it turned out it was it was
actually good that they didn't,

81
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:32,520
they didn't that we had to move
the interview because then all

82
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:34,350
that stuff happened with your
bandwidth and then the power

83
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:37,800
went off at work. And so then I
was like, I gotta go back. I

84
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,960
mean, I gotta get back to the
office now.

85
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:43,410
Adam Curry: Does it blip or does
it fail over nicely to the to

86
00:04:43,410 --> 00:04:46,860
the UPS is that handle the
switch over to the generator?

87
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:51,180
Dave Jones: Yes, it's same. It's
seamless. But see, we have for

88
00:04:51,210 --> 00:04:54,420
four reasons. We can't get
natural gas. We have diesel

89
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:55,950
generator. And so

90
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:58,830
Adam Curry: you are single
handedly responsible for climate

91
00:04:58,830 --> 00:04:59,640
change right now.

92
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,170
Dave Jones: If I was and I was I
was pouring five gallons of

93
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:08,430
climate change into the
generator with every jug less

94
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:08,550
than

95
00:05:10,349 --> 00:05:12,989
Adam Curry: five gallons of
climate change coming right up.

96
00:05:13,019 --> 00:05:15,899
That's how they should measure
it. Oh my god, yeah, pretty

97
00:05:15,899 --> 00:05:16,589
climate change.

98
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:20,970
Dave Jones: And that's the so I
got like, the lightning struck

99
00:05:20,970 --> 00:05:23,970
the power pole that feeds our
building and we have three phase

100
00:05:23,970 --> 00:05:27,750
power. So it took one of the
lines, it was just gone. I mean,

101
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:30,360
like it just blew the thing off
the pole. And

102
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:33,209
Adam Curry: what the whole
transformer blew right off the

103
00:05:33,209 --> 00:05:33,539
pole.

104
00:05:33,570 --> 00:05:35,460
Dave Jones: There wasn't a
transformer it's like it's like

105
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:39,240
there's it's three phase so you
get three lines coming in in one

106
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:45,420
one of the connector lines that
go off the main was just gone.

107
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:48,810
And so the power of come they
came out

108
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:52,230
Adam Curry: you didn't get your
your your gear out and clamp in

109
00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:53,640
the pole and reconnect that
thing.

110
00:05:55,050 --> 00:05:57,210
Dave Jones: I don't I don't
know. I don't do a lot of poll

111
00:05:57,210 --> 00:05:57,960
work these days.

112
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:01,110
Adam Curry: These days.

113
00:06:01,650 --> 00:06:07,890
Dave Jones: Now now I'm on all
this. Now, because the isobar is

114
00:06:07,890 --> 00:06:10,170
working so well now I'm just
feet. I'm trying to feed the

115
00:06:10,170 --> 00:06:11,790
isobar as much as I can I sell

116
00:06:11,790 --> 00:06:13,890
Adam Curry: bought is
unbelievable. I love I was just

117
00:06:13,890 --> 00:06:16,320
telling Tina, how that works is
that how does that happen? How

118
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:19,260
do they even do that? It's magic
map. They have running, running

119
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:21,000
some kind of transcript in real
time.

120
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:23,400
Dave Jones: But I got home about
one o'clock in the morning.

121
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:26,520
Adam Curry: Oh my goodness.
Power was back on by them.

122
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:29,730
Dave Jones: Yeah, where they
fixed so we had to turn because

123
00:06:29,730 --> 00:06:33,330
it wasn't actually all the way
out. It was just it was out of

124
00:06:33,330 --> 00:06:37,710
phase. Only one of the lines was
gone. So things were like

125
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:44,490
flickering lights. were flashing
like disco tech. Yeah.

126
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:47,370
Adam Curry: Phasing. Oh, that's
fantastic.

127
00:06:47,670 --> 00:06:50,940
Dave Jones: That was horrible.
It was scary. So they were like

128
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:52,440
yeah, we're shutting the whole
thing. We're just shutting the

129
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:55,950
whole Yeah, make sense. Anyway,
so did didn't want that. But it

130
00:06:55,950 --> 00:06:58,890
was it was just a weird, man.
It's just a weird weekend so

131
00:06:58,890 --> 00:07:00,330
far. Very strange.

132
00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:03,660
Adam Curry: Well, I'm so hot
man. So and you and your work

133
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:06,840
today as well at the office? I
did. Yeah. Because he went right

134
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:12,090
back in at nine o'clock. No. Was
there eight? Yeah. After getting

135
00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:12,810
home at one.

136
00:07:13,530 --> 00:07:15,600
Dave Jones: Yeah, but I'm gonna
I'm gonna sleep really good

137
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:18,300
tomorrow. Okay, I'm making that
today. I'm making up for it.

138
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:21,510
Tonight. I took a shower, before
the show to like, wake myself up

139
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:22,500
getting myself fired up.

140
00:07:22,530 --> 00:07:24,930
Adam Curry: Yeah. You're lit.

141
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:28,140
Dave Jones: Lit and lit. is lit
as I can

142
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:31,440
Adam Curry: get this show is
lit, which is the formula for

143
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:35,160
for success. As far as I'm
concerned. This is a live item

144
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:39,090
tag where if you use the
appropriate podcast app, you'll

145
00:07:39,090 --> 00:07:42,300
actually get an alert for this
pod verse seems to be the one

146
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:45,480
that's doing it the best I think
podcast addict has it and don't

147
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:49,770
is that out of beta yet. The
podcast addict alert system.

148
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:54,870
Okay. And of course, Europe
curio caster. I was looking at

149
00:07:54,870 --> 00:08:00,240
the charts yesterday. With me
spinning our tunes for two and a

150
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:05,760
half hours, something really
magically happened. And to me,

151
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:09,630
it was yeah, it happens during a
regular show, too. But there's

152
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:14,010
something about the audience
participation that just went

153
00:08:14,010 --> 00:08:17,910
with the flow. And, you know,
because of course we have the

154
00:08:17,910 --> 00:08:20,880
chat room when you when you use
pod verse, the chat room opens

155
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:24,240
up, you get the live signal. You
go into the live the live item

156
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:27,090
right there and your list. You
can chat along and you can boost

157
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:30,660
in real time. And I think was
Todd Cochran. Mr. Blueberry, he

158
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:35,250
started off. He's like 25,000
SATs and he wanted a song. And

159
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:39,210
he said right there, the next
request has to be five more. And

160
00:08:39,210 --> 00:08:42,690
it was like, Okay, the next one
was 30,000. And then I think,

161
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:48,750
was Carolyn Blaney. She sent
20,000 requested something, but

162
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:52,710
blueberry came in and said, I'm
gonna add 15,000 to make up so

163
00:08:52,710 --> 00:08:55,740
it's 35 for her request. And
people just do things up and up

164
00:08:55,740 --> 00:09:00,720
and up, like 5060 70,000 SATs
and requests and I'm like, stop.

165
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:06,210
First of all, I was embarrassed.
Yeah. But also, I discovered

166
00:09:06,210 --> 00:09:11,520
something else. When you open up
the stream to requests, you get

167
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:14,970
a lot of shit. It's not really
necessarily in the groove of the

168
00:09:14,970 --> 00:09:19,260
dance party. Metallica Okay,
right? Yeah, I like Metallica

169
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:22,380
too. It's just, you know, and
then followed by polka music

170
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:25,770
from Weird Al Yankovic it was it
was a little a little hectic, it

171
00:09:25,770 --> 00:09:29,430
was all over the spectrum. But
we had a good very reminiscent

172
00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:32,400
Dave Jones: of FUBAR Fridays
with the Dropbox.

173
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:35,640
Adam Curry: Daily source code.
Exactly.

174
00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:38,190
Dave Jones: Yeah, that was all
over the map to like some of the

175
00:09:38,190 --> 00:09:40,200
some of those was like, okay,
yeah,

176
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:43,410
Adam Curry: yeah, yeah. But it
was it was really fun. And it

177
00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:48,090
was just nice to see everyone
kind of go with the flow. And

178
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:52,830
that's something that we're
bringing something really

179
00:09:52,830 --> 00:09:56,070
beautiful back that existed
many, many many years ago. I

180
00:09:56,070 --> 00:10:01,080
mean, these days you even have
Okay, I should probably play

181
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:07,740
this chat GPT is now doing radio
GPT they're literally pitching

182
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:15,960
AI voices to run your radio
station. And I got to play this

183
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:20,280
this little demo they have. So
as I've done a lot of top 40

184
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:25,440
radio work certainly in the in
the 90s, late 80s, early 90s it

185
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,990
already was very formulaic. Now
you had a lot of leeway

186
00:10:27,990 --> 00:10:30,900
depending on who you were what
time slot you have, you know

187
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:36,150
what station, but in general,
Steve Kingston legendary program

188
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:39,360
director who was at GE 100 When
I was there, he would say, Hey,

189
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:43,890
man, and a monkey could do this.
Just read the liner cards and

190
00:10:43,890 --> 00:10:48,690
hit the button. And literally,
that's it always ended with z

191
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:49,320
100.

192
00:10:51,390 --> 00:10:52,620
Dave Jones: That's in New York,
right? Z. When

193
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:55,710
Adam Curry: do you want 100?
Toby? Yeah, I was brought in by

194
00:10:55,710 --> 00:10:58,680
Scott Shannon, who's the legend
who I've you know, had probably

195
00:10:58,710 --> 00:11:01,650
any of my radio career to thank
because I emulated him so much.

196
00:11:02,010 --> 00:11:06,840
So the I all the elements that
you know, just for the regular

197
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:09,750
jocks I will say for you know,
except for drive time in the

198
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:13,770
morning, and drive time in the
afternoon. everyone kind of has

199
00:11:13,770 --> 00:11:16,920
to follow these rules overnight.
You could break some some, some

200
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:21,330
rules and stuff, but now they
still the most expensive part of

201
00:11:21,330 --> 00:11:24,840
any organization is going to be
people so screw the DJs get rid

202
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:27,570
of the button pushers. We don't
even need monkeys anymore.

203
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:32,850
Listen to this promo from radio
GPT. And by the way, everything

204
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:36,270

something that you are told and

205

Adam Curry: So this this drivel
and by the way, they have a

258
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:10,800
video of this of this AI bot she
doesn't blink and trust me to be

259
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:13,710
a good podcast or like me you
got to blink have to read all

260
00:14:13,710 --> 00:14:16,830
kinds of ticks otherwise you
just no good you got to have

261
00:14:16,830 --> 00:14:17,070
that

262
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:19,260
Dave Jones: most that's the
bottom bar

263
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:25,260
Adam Curry: is not blinking. So
this of course is atrocious. But

264
00:14:25,290 --> 00:14:29,580
this will this will get get
radio airtime people will do

265
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:33,810
this. And compared to what we
had going on yesterday. It's

266
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:38,430
there's just no comparison that
the thing lived it live. And

267
00:14:38,430 --> 00:14:42,060
people were feeding back in real
time. The whole thing was just a

268
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:46,080
beautiful experience. It was so
special about it

269
00:14:46,350 --> 00:14:51,480
Dave Jones: as a DJ Yeah. I
mean, so this is this was great.

270
00:14:51,930 --> 00:14:58,770
So I'm listening to the bootleg.
And, and, and it's it reminded

271
00:14:58,770 --> 00:15:01,920
me so you weren't expecting
thing. You weren't expecting for

272
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:04,890
things to go in that direction?
No, I was not like better No,

273
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:07,680
yeah, back in the day when you
would do a daily source code and

274
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:10,920
things would you came in knowing
what you were getting your your

275
00:15:11,070 --> 00:15:11,940
bad rest on,

276
00:15:12,150 --> 00:15:13,890
Adam Curry: that allows stuff.
Yeah, good to go. Yeah.

277
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:18,090
Dave Jones: And so this, this,
this evolved at the first, maybe

278
00:15:18,090 --> 00:15:23,040
the first 15 minutes or so 20
minutes, you're kind of like

279
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:27,090
understanding where this thing
was headed. About 30 minutes

280
00:15:27,090 --> 00:15:29,490
into it, you're hitting the
groove, I'm gonna like it was.

281
00:15:29,790 --> 00:15:33,030
And then and then an hour in,
you were just, I mean, it was

282
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:36,690
full, it was like it was 2004
all over again. I mean, these

283
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:40,410
are 2007. I mean, he's been,
you're killing it.

284
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,870
Adam Curry: The thing that was
that was weird is I, you know,

285
00:15:42,870 --> 00:15:47,400
Spotify, the he used to have.
Spotify would allow third party

286
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:50,730
apps. And you could have two
songs or more even. But you

287
00:15:50,730 --> 00:15:54,150
could have two tracks, one
playing and one queued up. So

288
00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:56,880
while one is playing, you can
then go listen to another one.

289
00:15:57,060 --> 00:16:00,150
But if you only have one,
Spotify app, you can't queue

290
00:16:00,150 --> 00:16:03,870
anything up. So I was literally
like stopping it clicking on

291
00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:06,390
something while I'm talking
clicking on the next one. And

292
00:16:06,390 --> 00:16:08,340
then because it had to load for
a second, you know, the

293
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:11,310
bandwidth was kind of shitty as
well. So I was really just, you

294
00:16:11,310 --> 00:16:16,950
know, it was very, very low bar
low tech, to do it this way. And

295
00:16:16,950 --> 00:16:20,010
luckily, I had a couple of
tracks myself. So, you know, if

296
00:16:20,010 --> 00:16:22,680
I was trying to queue something
up, I could, you know, do

297
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:25,920
something else on a different a
pre fader Listen, but it was

298
00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:30,330
definitely not ideal from a,
from a music library standpoint,

299
00:16:30,330 --> 00:16:32,610
it's too bad that Spotify
doesn't allow you to do that

300
00:16:32,610 --> 00:16:33,120
anymore.

301
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:37,080
Dave Jones: I've never done
obviously never done any of that

302
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:40,410
kind of thing. So I'm imagining
that the way it goes is your the

303
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:46,710
the track this live is playing
and then you and then off sort

304
00:16:46,710 --> 00:16:51,120
of offline or off air pre prefix
you okay, you're listening to

305
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:53,430
the next tried to get up to
figure out what's what is going

306
00:16:53,430 --> 00:16:56,400
to be Yeah, and then you cute.
You're okay. That's how it goes.

307
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:59,370
Yeah. The fact that you couldn't
do that, and it was still as

308
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:02,010
smooth as it was. I mean, your
brother?

309
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:05,070
Adam Curry: Totally. Hey, I'm
also available for bar mitzvahs

310
00:17:05,070 --> 00:17:13,020
and weddings. boosters,
boosters, boosters live. We've

311
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:17,490
saved yet another life. I'm very
happy to. Very happy. Yeah,

312
00:17:17,490 --> 00:17:22,440
well. I think this person wanted
to stay anonymous. Okay, thanks

313
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:26,940
for opening my eyes to the pod
fasting side effects, which I

314
00:17:26,940 --> 00:17:31,500
think is called pod speeding.
Because sound pod pod fasting

315
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:34,020
Dave Jones: sounds like you're
not lucky like you're listening.

316
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:34,800
Yes, yes.

317
00:17:34,890 --> 00:17:38,310
Adam Curry: So my use case was
this. I tried to listen to the

318
00:17:38,310 --> 00:17:43,260
show live on pod verse. But my
wife is in Germany, but my wife

319
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:45,480
wouldn't let me listen to the
whole show. So the next morning,

320
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:49,410
I would one point 25 bit to re
listen to the bits I heard, live

321
00:17:49,410 --> 00:17:52,680
and catch up on the missed out
sections. Of course, this meant

322
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:55,860
that I'd be fidgety the day
after now I know why. And I

323
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:57,060
won't do it again.

324
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:00,570
Dave Jones: Thank you very much
about that. There's a delay.

325
00:18:00,570 --> 00:18:03,840
There's your it takes you a day
to come down.

326
00:18:03,870 --> 00:18:07,350
Adam Curry: Yes. Okay, well, how
about this? So RTP Richard

327
00:18:07,350 --> 00:18:11,820
Peterson, key cop something when
you and I were discussing this,

328
00:18:12,030 --> 00:18:16,320
and it really blew my mind I
have to set it up. So when we

329
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:19,980
were talking about you know that
this stuff can hijack your

330
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:23,550
nervous system and makes you
impatient with the people you

331
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:28,260
around you who you love or nip
the office or your kids. It

332
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:32,190
conditions you to accept fake
people like that radio GPT lady,

333
00:18:32,610 --> 00:18:35,820
you know, there's a whole bunch
of downsides to it. And you said

334
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:38,040
that, you know, you had heard me
bitching about this several

335
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:42,570
years ago. And and you stopped
doing it and you notice that

336
00:18:42,930 --> 00:18:45,390
immediately you or not like a
day or two later you had more

337
00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:47,940
patience, right? Am I my
recounting that correctly?

338
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:50,430
Dave Jones: Yeah, it took a
couple of days it took two three

339
00:18:50,430 --> 00:18:54,480
days and then I realized that
everything felt more right and

340
00:18:54,510 --> 00:18:58,140
like everything just felt
normal. And like like as far as

341
00:18:58,140 --> 00:19:01,230
listening to the speak because I
was so used to I've been

342
00:19:01,230 --> 00:19:07,020
listening to you guys for years
on fast speed and it took it

343
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:12,840
took two or three days for me to
get used to not hearing you like

344
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:16,860
that. But then it's like is as
soon as my mind adjusted to it,

345
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:20,580
everything else fell into place
to own on like in the world.

346
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:24,960
Adam Curry: So one of the things
you would use is the silence

347
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:31,860
chopper. From Yes, so now listen
to that podcast. So this is last

348
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:38,310
week's board meeting the minute
you start talking about the sped

349
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:44,370
up chopped silences you actually
start talking fast. Listen to it

350
00:19:44,490 --> 00:19:46,410
as a as a reformed

351
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:51,270
Dave Jones: podcast, multi multi
multi XOR I don't know what you

352
00:19:51,270 --> 00:19:55,170
call that multispeed person
sick. Yeah. Yeah, as a

353
00:19:56,910 --> 00:19:58,320
Unknown: form, sicko. Yeah,

354
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:01,920
Dave Jones: I used I used to
listen to All my podcasts in one

355
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:07,680
at one point I speed up speed up
with the with the whatever

356
00:20:07,710 --> 00:20:10,380
whatever that thing is where
chops out the silences between

357
00:20:10,410 --> 00:20:11,190
them and all that kind of stuff.

358
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:12,990
Adam Curry: Yeah, the silence
chopper. Did you hear what you

359
00:20:12,990 --> 00:20:15,330
just did there? Yeah, I started

360
00:20:15,330 --> 00:20:17,730
Dave Jones: as I just went, boom

361
00:20:17,730 --> 00:20:19,380
Adam Curry: a little bit. Yeah.
And then and then right after

362
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:21,480
that you slow down again listen,
listen,

363
00:20:21,659 --> 00:20:23,849
Dave Jones: whatever, whatever
that thing is where chops out

364
00:20:23,849 --> 00:20:25,829
the silences between them and
all that kind of stuff. Yeah,

365
00:20:25,829 --> 00:20:29,669
the silence chopper. Silence Joe
Yeah. And then.

366
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,820
Adam Curry: And then you go back
to normal speed. I think that

367
00:20:33,510 --> 00:20:36,420
it's still in you. The
programming is still there. You

368
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:39,120
need you need an exorcism, I
believe I believe

369
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:40,410
Dave Jones: it's a virus

370
00:20:46,950 --> 00:20:52,200
Adam Curry: you're cured, you're
healed. Thank you for that.

371
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:56,220
Fantastic observation.

372
00:20:56,610 --> 00:20:58,350
Dave Jones: This is a good
observation because I'm

373
00:20:58,830 --> 00:21:03,330
naturally sort of a stammer
because I try to get my brain

374
00:21:03,330 --> 00:21:09,300
goes faster than my mouth. So I
have to get them in sync. And if

375
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:14,130
I I do this, the way I talk on
the show is exactly the way I

376
00:21:14,130 --> 00:21:18,330
talk to people in all around me
all the time. And I realize that

377
00:21:18,330 --> 00:21:21,960
it frustrates them. And so I
tried to talk slower, but then

378
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:25,440
if it could, because when I talk
fast, my stammering gets way

379
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:28,770
worse. It's not stuttering. It's
not like that Nina is not like

380
00:21:28,770 --> 00:21:33,480
that, is because I start a
sentence. Realize it realize

381
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:37,050
that that's not the right way to
start it and then go back and

382
00:21:37,050 --> 00:21:40,770
sometimes I'll start a sentence
three times in a row. And it

383
00:21:40,770 --> 00:21:44,850
drives Melissa crazy. So like,
the faster I get it becomes just

384
00:21:44,910 --> 00:21:47,160
like it turns into mush.

385
00:21:47,190 --> 00:21:50,550
Adam Curry: Oh, that's
interesting. Well, actually, I

386
00:21:50,550 --> 00:21:55,590
find the way you talk very
engaging I in fact, I enjoy it.

387
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:58,860
Believe me if I didn't like it,
I would be fuck this thing. I'm

388
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:04,260
not gonna this board meeting for
two hours. But I enjoy

389
00:22:04,530 --> 00:22:09,750
personally. I like flaws. I like
it when people except the

390
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:12,270
president, the president, he has
no brains left. I mean, that's

391
00:22:12,270 --> 00:22:16,530
different. What he's what he's
got going on there. But I like

392
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:21,540
Cridland has also has a stammer.
And it's quite endearing. He is

393
00:22:22,470 --> 00:22:27,810
M's and ELLs. And I like it. I
like that kind of stuff.

394
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:30,990
Dave Jones: I like the humanity
of it in Yeah. Oh, yeah. It

395
00:22:30,990 --> 00:22:31,230
makes

396
00:22:31,230 --> 00:22:34,650
Adam Curry: you human. It's the
exact opposite of the robo jock.

397
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:37,560
Dave Jones: That's yeah, that
shakes said nothing wrong.

398
00:22:37,710 --> 00:22:41,550
Adam Curry: Right. There's
nothing wrong, nothing unique.

399
00:22:41,550 --> 00:22:45,780
Nothing interesting. Nothing
that makes you and certainly the

400
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:49,200
writing was inhumane. I mean,
you know, it's like, this stuff,

401
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:54,240
in my opinion, all that those
little nuances will never work.

402
00:22:54,330 --> 00:22:58,350
Unless, you know, people start
tricking themselves by listening

403
00:22:58,350 --> 00:23:03,360
to roboticized speech to begin
with, which is what pod speeding

404
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:05,100
is. Your

405
00:23:05,130 --> 00:23:08,550
Dave Jones: I immediately I
immediately heard the problem

406
00:23:08,550 --> 00:23:13,800
with that. You know, AI bots?
Yeah, the DJ no fake DJ vanilla.

407
00:23:14,430 --> 00:23:23,910
Yeah, it's funny how it like,
have you seen the AR RT stuff?

408
00:23:23,910 --> 00:23:28,740
And it always messes up the
hands? Yes. Like the floors look

409
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:32,820
like they're look like a bunch
of chopsticks by the way yeah,

410
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:35,100
that's there's something about
you sound like

411
00:23:35,130 --> 00:23:37,200
Adam Curry: she sounded like
that. But like chopstick

412
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:45,600
fingers, yeah, sounds like, this
is the value for value podcast.

413
00:23:45,750 --> 00:23:48,900
For those who need an
explanation. We have a whole

414
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:52,890
website for IT value number four
value dot info. But the whole

415
00:23:52,890 --> 00:23:56,820
concept is, we give you value,
which is free for anyone to

416
00:23:56,820 --> 00:24:00,600
receive. Because of course, we
can charge what we want and make

417
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:04,920
it set up behind a paywall or
make it to premium content only.

418
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:08,040
But only you can determine what
something's worth to you. And

419
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:11,970
maybe a lot of money is 50 cents
or $5 a month or a week or

420
00:24:11,970 --> 00:24:15,540
whatever. And maybe $500 is what
it's worth to you because of

421
00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:18,900
some incredible tip that we gave
you or we made you feel good or

422
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:22,380
made you laugh or made you feel
human, you get to determine that

423
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:25,500
and send it back to us. And we
prefer if you do it in a modern

424
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:29,250
podcast app, podcast apps.com is
where you can find a whole bunch

425
00:24:29,250 --> 00:24:32,550
of someone who had an since we
have so many apps and services

426
00:24:32,550 --> 00:24:38,730
now using the podcast index, and
the API associated with it that

427
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:42,720
we should probably put the edge
that actually forward you to

428
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:46,710
podcast index.org/apps We should
probably only put apps there now

429
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:51,330
and then and make a new section
for all the different hosting

430
00:24:51,330 --> 00:24:54,390
companies and services. Which
probably Yeah, I agree with

431
00:24:55,350 --> 00:24:57,330
Dave Jones: that because you
just like you go to podcast

432
00:24:57,330 --> 00:24:59,370
apps.com And you see Buzzsprout

433
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:03,660
Adam Curry: Yeah, Is that
someone something anyone can do

434
00:25:03,660 --> 00:25:06,630
with? With a, with a pull
request? That'd be great. That'd

435
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:09,690
be great. If we can get those
TPS reports done by tomorrow,

436
00:25:09,690 --> 00:25:14,790
that'd be great. Just ask me,
that's real value there. We

437
00:25:14,790 --> 00:25:17,610
would appreciate if someone did
that as value for value that is

438
00:25:17,610 --> 00:25:20,130
valid. valid value.

439
00:25:20,550 --> 00:25:23,970
Dave Jones: The comments, the
cross out comments work on the

440
00:25:23,970 --> 00:25:32,730
website continues. Yeah. And
gourmet. Nathan, John, they're

441
00:25:32,730 --> 00:25:34,890
continuing, you know, they're
just chipping away at this

442
00:25:34,890 --> 00:25:39,000
thing. And I was was going to
get the latest pull request out

443
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,700
today into production, but I
didn't get a chance to but there

444
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:44,550
I mean, that they're continuing
to do I think they may have

445
00:25:44,550 --> 00:25:49,950
their eyes set on posting, like
feedback like replies.

446
00:25:50,490 --> 00:25:54,510
Adam Curry: Oh, okay. Oh, right.
From the right from the website.

447
00:25:54,929 --> 00:25:58,019
Dave Jones: Yeah, yeah. And so
the changelog podcast guys got

448
00:25:58,019 --> 00:26:02,939
in there. And we're pitching in
to on Oh, cool, awesome stuff.

449
00:26:02,939 --> 00:26:05,759
So yeah, I mean, it's, it's
going somewhere. There's this a

450
00:26:05,759 --> 00:26:09,539
team effort, the website being
open source is fantastic. Number

451
00:26:09,539 --> 00:26:11,699
one, because you don't have the
amount of

452
00:26:12,180 --> 00:26:13,950
Adam Curry: time to time.

453
00:26:14,730 --> 00:26:18,240
Dave Jones: Yeah, you know, it's
funny, it's funny, not being a

454
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:21,630
JavaScript guy. I learned all
the horrible things about

455
00:26:21,630 --> 00:26:24,540
JavaScript after the fact. So
these are all new to me. Yeah.

456
00:26:24,570 --> 00:26:29,370
And and I say, Oh, my God date
is zero indexed on the month and

457
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:33,330
everyone's like, Oh, yeah, you
can tell the funding this years

458
00:26:33,330 --> 00:26:34,020
to life,

459
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:37,590
Adam Curry: as well. So since
you mentioned that, I have, I

460
00:26:37,590 --> 00:26:42,720
have a comment about the
integration of get Alby and

461
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:48,900
websites. So the experience is
as follows. And I noticed this,

462
00:26:49,110 --> 00:26:53,790
it really hit me when I used pod
verse on the web, the web

463
00:26:53,790 --> 00:27:00,360
version. Here's the experience.
So you have your your wallet

464
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:04,800
connected, or you're using the
lb extension. So let's take

465
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:09,300
podcast index.org as an example.
And there's a beautiful box and

466
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:12,840
you type it all in and you hit
go with the number. And then

467
00:27:12,930 --> 00:27:15,540
I'll be if you're not already
authorized, I'll be able to go

468
00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:19,500
through that process. And then
it pops up and it says, pay this

469
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:24,450
amount to this person, sit,
create a budget. You know,

470
00:27:24,450 --> 00:27:29,250
always remember, this was all
these options, because it has to

471
00:27:29,250 --> 00:27:32,790
go through the splits, it does
each one independently. And if

472
00:27:32,790 --> 00:27:35,310
you don't know what you're
doing, if you don't say you do

473
00:27:35,310 --> 00:27:39,660
this, then it spits back every
single time. It's like people

474
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:42,540
you don't know it's very
confusing. And the whole budget

475
00:27:42,540 --> 00:27:46,800
thing it's like, what we need is
an explanation. And the same

476
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:49,950
goes for when you do it with POD
verse on the web. So get Albie,

477
00:27:50,190 --> 00:27:53,370
because I got a very nice boost
today. But it didn't go through

478
00:27:53,370 --> 00:27:57,240
the splits. And I know why.
Because it was just a user I'd

479
00:27:57,240 --> 00:28:01,170
get Alby and they're using the
extension popped it up curry in

480
00:28:01,170 --> 00:28:04,020
the keeper, boom, and then
whatever else happened that just

481
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:09,690
dumped out. So we've that has to
be and I understand why from the

482
00:28:09,690 --> 00:28:12,810
get Alby side, I understand, but
that has to be looked at so

483
00:28:12,810 --> 00:28:16,470
maybe Bumi. And the guys can can
take a look at just making it a

484
00:28:16,470 --> 00:28:18,840
little more clear. You know,
what is a budget? Why do I need

485
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:21,600
a budget? Do I want a budget?
Why do I have to remember this

486
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:25,260
for the rest? You know, just it
needs? We need some explanation

487
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:28,440
there. Just some words that
explain to people what's

488
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:29,100
happening.

489
00:28:30,030 --> 00:28:31,980
Dave Jones: Yeah, I've noticed
that too. And I've kind of

490
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:33,480
forgotten about it. Yeah.

491
00:28:35,490 --> 00:28:36,360
Adam Curry: I have Trillium.

492
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:39,300
Dave Jones: Oh, yeah, that thing
you're you're

493
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:43,080
Adam Curry: organizing. Yes. My
second brain. Exactly. Yeah,

494
00:28:43,110 --> 00:28:46,050
Dave Jones: admit, to bring that
up a few times. Because it runs

495
00:28:46,050 --> 00:28:48,810
you through. It's like, okay,
sand, sand, sand. Sand is it

496
00:28:48,810 --> 00:28:50,160
runs through every one of those.
Yeah,

497
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:53,910
Adam Curry: and we know what's
happening. But mere mortals and

498
00:28:53,910 --> 00:28:57,210
then we're not talking the
podcast, mere mortals will have

499
00:28:57,210 --> 00:29:01,680
an issue. So that will be
something that that we could

500
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:02,160
work on.

501
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:06,660
Dave Jones: Let me throw let me
throw this at you. Maybe at a

502
00:29:06,660 --> 00:29:09,240
left field here or it may not be
I don't know where your where

503
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:12,150
your minds at but what do you
think about the Spreaker thing

504
00:29:12,150 --> 00:29:14,730
going free? Did you see that?
Yeah.

505
00:29:15,450 --> 00:29:19,380
Adam Curry: I think it's a bit
of a red herring. Because it's

506
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:23,340
not entirely free. Yes, storage
may be free. But there are still

507
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:26,760
different tiers. It's kind of a
thing. It's a little bit of a

508
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:27,660
bait and switch.

509
00:29:28,169 --> 00:29:30,539
Dave Jones: Okay, you may you
sound like you know more about

510
00:29:30,539 --> 00:29:33,329
this than me because I tried to
figure out what they meant and I

511
00:29:33,329 --> 00:29:36,719
couldn't make their press
release make sense. I went

512
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:39,420
Adam Curry: to the source I went
to the guru Todd Cochran.

513
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:43,860
Cochran told me now this is bait
and switch, they've got they've

514
00:29:43,860 --> 00:29:47,280
got they still have different
levels and you don't get

515
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:52,050
everything. It is definitely a
nice offering. To me. It's a

516
00:29:52,050 --> 00:29:56,460
Hail Mary. It's like what are we
going to do now? This is I heart

517
00:29:56,460 --> 00:29:58,620
I believe, right? Do they own
Spreaker?

518
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:01,920
Dave Jones: Yes, and I've got
So, I would like to dig in on

519
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:04,530
that, after you say this,
because I've got some, I've got

520
00:30:04,530 --> 00:30:05,490
some art stuff.

521
00:30:05,730 --> 00:30:12,150
Adam Curry: Oh, good. It seems
like some Todd didn't seem

522
00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:16,620
overly concerned about it. I'm
very concerned in general,

523
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:21,750
because I just don't believe in
free. Because there is no such

524
00:30:21,750 --> 00:30:25,140
thing as free. And you're gonna
get screwed somewhere down the

525
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:29,970
line. If anything by by getting
the rug pulled from under you, I

526
00:30:29,970 --> 00:30:35,460
don't like it because I know how
much goes into running a good

527
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:39,570
host and the I don't know much
about Spreaker I believe back in

528
00:30:39,570 --> 00:30:44,580
the early days, Spreaker was
caching the content early, early

529
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:47,580
days long time, I may be wrong,
but that was Stitcher. I'm

530
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:53,190
sorry, write your stitches, a
scrap that I know what goes into

531
00:30:53,190 --> 00:30:56,460
making a hosting company work,
especially with customer

532
00:30:56,460 --> 00:31:02,190
service. And I want all of our,
all of the hosting companies to

533
00:31:02,190 --> 00:31:06,180
prosper, and I want them to be
able to, to, you know, to

534
00:31:06,180 --> 00:31:08,910
provide good customer service
and good service in general at a

535
00:31:08,910 --> 00:31:14,040
fair price. And something like
this comes along. And you know,

536
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:17,640
it's kind of like anchor so it
may also pollute, you know, just

537
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:20,190
get a lot of pollution out
there, I think is probably to

538
00:31:20,190 --> 00:31:25,050
jack up their numbers. Look how
many podcasts we've got. So I

539
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:30,360
did I just don't hold them in
high regard for doing this. And

540
00:31:30,660 --> 00:31:35,190
it just doesn't seem like I
mean, I feel and then I'd love

541
00:31:35,190 --> 00:31:38,850
to hear what about the I heart
stuff, I feel personally that

542
00:31:38,850 --> 00:31:45,390
there should be a way for
podcast host to bring people on

543
00:31:45,450 --> 00:31:49,710
at a quid pro quo of value for
value. It's like, we're gonna

544
00:31:49,710 --> 00:31:54,330
take 20% Split until a certain
amount, or whatever, if you want

545
00:31:54,330 --> 00:31:57,690
to pay, you know, you can pay
instead of doing that it's all

546
00:31:57,690 --> 00:32:00,600
enabled right out of the gate.
Something like that, I think

547
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:03,570
would be a great offering. And I
think that people would pick up

548
00:32:03,570 --> 00:32:06,300
on it. And I think that you'd
probably make more than 20 bucks

549
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:09,210
a month that you that you do
normally from these podcasts. So

550
00:32:09,330 --> 00:32:11,100
it would be a net win in my
mind.

551
00:32:11,699 --> 00:32:14,249
Dave Jones: Well, that's the
only way I can make this make

552
00:32:14,249 --> 00:32:19,679
sense. And this is before I've
fully understood that it wasn't

553
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:21,779
free across the board. Because I
was thinking at first I was

554
00:32:21,779 --> 00:32:24,269
thinking, Oh, this is a Charles
Schwab type deal. You know what

555
00:32:24,269 --> 00:32:29,339
I mean? Where they? Schwab was
about three years ago, dropped

556
00:32:29,339 --> 00:32:31,259
their commission fees on trades.
Oh, yeah.

557
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:33,750
Adam Curry: And everyone
dropped? Yeah, everybody had to

558
00:32:33,750 --> 00:32:34,500
drop it. Yeah.

559
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:37,080
Dave Jones: And so I thought it
was free across the board. But

560
00:32:37,230 --> 00:32:40,320
this is a little it changes a
little bit. But I still I still

561
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:46,050
think some of this may apply.
Maybe they are looking out and

562
00:32:46,050 --> 00:32:50,130
they know something ever, I
think, at least on our show me

563
00:32:50,130 --> 00:32:54,270
and you both believe that anchor
isn't going to last forever.

564
00:32:54,270 --> 00:32:57,360
It's going to fold at some
point. It's too much of an

565
00:32:57,360 --> 00:33:01,470
albatross around around Spotify
neck. And that's completely

566
00:33:01,470 --> 00:33:07,890
free. Maybe the the ease of use
of the of the anchor app and all

567
00:33:07,890 --> 00:33:10,470
that stuff was you know, the
thing that made it a train

568
00:33:10,470 --> 00:33:14,490
wreck. I mean, maybe they just
think that their ad dai ad

569
00:33:14,490 --> 00:33:17,910
offering is enough to make up
the difference of all this. You

570
00:33:17,910 --> 00:33:18,180
know,

571
00:33:18,780 --> 00:33:23,010
Adam Curry: what, how about that
maybe? Good point. Maybe they're

572
00:33:23,010 --> 00:33:26,460
thinking, Hey, as long as we get
enough people, jump folks with

573
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:29,580
with a with a podcast feed will
actually be able to fulfill the

574
00:33:29,580 --> 00:33:30,300
inventory.

575
00:33:30,959 --> 00:33:32,429
Dave Jones: Yeah, that's what
I'm thinking. Yeah,

576
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:33,960
Adam Curry: that makes sense.
That makes sense.

577
00:33:34,199 --> 00:33:35,789
Dave Jones: Okay, well, that
leads me into this. I brought

578
00:33:35,789 --> 00:33:43,529
some clips. Do you have my
clips? I do. The lets you know,

579
00:33:43,529 --> 00:33:49,709
there was some talk about Marcos
discussion on I guess it was

580
00:33:49,709 --> 00:33:53,489
MacBreak. Weekly, which I did
not watch. Yeah, I didn't watch

581
00:33:53,489 --> 00:33:57,239
it initially. And then I and
then I did and it, you know,

582
00:33:57,239 --> 00:33:59,759
it's fine. I had, I really
didn't have much of a problem

583
00:33:59,759 --> 00:34:02,189
with I think there was some
misunderstanding with chapters.

584
00:34:02,189 --> 00:34:05,219
But other than that, I mean,
basically, Marco at least he

585
00:34:05,219 --> 00:34:07,439
basically just said, I don't
want people telling me what to

586
00:34:07,439 --> 00:34:07,799
do.

587
00:34:08,820 --> 00:34:11,010
Adam Curry: And you know, I hear
you. I don't want people telling

588
00:34:11,010 --> 00:34:11,880
me what to do either.

589
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:15,720
Dave Jones: I don't either. And
so I'm like, Okay, I mean, I

590
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:20,490
really wasn't bothered by
anything that he said. But the

591
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:23,040
more interesting part of their
conversation that was about

592
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:30,270
advertising, and the display,
Lea one ad market is life

593
00:34:30,270 --> 00:34:30,750
threatening.

594
00:34:30,959 --> 00:34:32,759
Unknown: We're going through I
don't know about you, Marco and

595
00:34:32,759 --> 00:34:35,489
I don't know, we've heard from
other podcasters. We're going

596
00:34:35,489 --> 00:34:40,139
through an advertising downturn
that is existential, it's life

597
00:34:40,139 --> 00:34:40,469
threatening.

598
00:34:40,499 --> 00:34:45,239
Oh, yeah. It's not that bad for
our show. But it's, it's this is

599
00:34:45,239 --> 00:34:47,939
the worst ad market we've seen
in probably a few years. Yeah.

600
00:34:48,510 --> 00:34:53,730
Adam Curry: Yeah. Well, that is
only accentuated by NPR, who say

601
00:34:53,730 --> 00:34:57,480
they have a $30 million deficit
and it's pretty much from the

602
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:58,770
podcasting department.

603
00:34:59,490 --> 00:35:03,750
Dave Jones: Yeah, not So I think
there's a clearly there's shows

604
00:35:03,750 --> 00:35:06,630
out there that are doing they're
doing just fine. And as the

605
00:35:06,630 --> 00:35:12,150
Independence shows they have
kept their in markets that

606
00:35:12,150 --> 00:35:14,430
they're doing. They're doing
okay. That mean they're not

607
00:35:14,430 --> 00:35:15,570
doing great but they're doing if
I

608
00:35:15,570 --> 00:35:18,870
Adam Curry: may, and I don't
know much about it but but what

609
00:35:18,870 --> 00:35:22,680
I know from the past with AD
markets, if you have a brides

610
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:27,390
magazine, you're always going to
get DJs venues dressmakers, and

611
00:35:27,420 --> 00:35:30,480
and you know this this was the
PC Magazine, you know, back in

612
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:33,510
the day, you know, you're gonna
get Dell and HP and everyone's

613
00:35:33,510 --> 00:35:35,370
gonna advertise because it's
just kind of built into their

614
00:35:35,370 --> 00:35:40,500
budget. If you're a general
program, a general podcast, and

615
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:47,910
you're looking for BMW and and
and T Mobile, etc. Get that's

616
00:35:47,910 --> 00:35:53,040
where you're gonna get cut. So a
specialist tech podcast or we

617
00:35:53,070 --> 00:35:56,970
like a Bitcoin podcast, I'm sure
there may be some some pullback

618
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,700
on the on the overall numbers.
But that's pretty much what

619
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:01,890
you're, you're still going to
get that it may even involve

620
00:36:01,890 --> 00:36:05,190
more host reads I don't think
that the dynamic inserted ad

621
00:36:05,190 --> 00:36:08,130
market is probably the is really
being affected. But apparently,

622
00:36:08,910 --> 00:36:15,030
even in Leo's network, he says
existential. I think that's

623
00:36:15,030 --> 00:36:17,700
because he just has too many
people too many shows. And as we

624
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:20,760
all know, you can't you can't
monetize the network. If it's

625
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:23,250
just twit itself. I'm sure
that's doing fine. I'm sure

626
00:36:23,250 --> 00:36:26,730
security now is doing okay. But
everything else yeah, it may

627
00:36:26,730 --> 00:36:28,890
just be a pullback, because just
too much

628
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:33,450
Unknown: play Lea to it. This is
normal. This is normal behavior.

629
00:36:33,450 --> 00:36:36,900
And when you're at the bottom of
the down, it might feel like the

630
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:39,660
world's never going to come
back. But it will eventually.

631
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:43,620
Good tell that to my AD team.
Okay. Actually, we have a we

632
00:36:43,620 --> 00:36:47,100
have an unusual problem, because
foolishly we built something

633
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:50,760
that has high overhead. Yeah.
And I mean, we have a two and a

634
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:56,040
half million dollar a year. Not.
So we don't have the luxury of

635
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:58,800
saying, well, if advertising,
Stan will just weather it and go

636
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:01,410
through it. Thank goodness that
we did do that. And I think

637
00:37:01,410 --> 00:37:05,190
everybody who's in podcasting,
for real understands that the

638
00:37:05,190 --> 00:37:08,130
only thing that keeps podcasting
and live as the community, the

639
00:37:08,130 --> 00:37:11,190
listeners, the people who you
have a relationship, direct

640
00:37:11,190 --> 00:37:14,490
relationship with, and clubs,
Patreon, that kind of thing

641
00:37:14,490 --> 00:37:18,330
really give not only give you
that little extra income, but

642
00:37:18,330 --> 00:37:21,300
they make a big difference in
bonding the audience to you. So

643
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:24,360
we two years ago, we created
club twit, and that was that was

644
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:29,490
a huge part of it. But it's
still I mean, it's still 1/10 of

645
00:37:29,490 --> 00:37:33,000
1% or something, maybe it's I
would love if I get 5% of the

646
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,880
audience to subscribe, we
wouldn't need advertisers. But
